One of tmux’s biggest advantages is that we can fire it up, start up programs or processes inside the tmux environment, and then leave it running in the background by “detaching” from the session `< C-b d >`.If we close a regular terminal session, all the programs we have running inthat session are killed off. But when we detach from a tmux session, we’renot actually closing tmux. Any programs we started up in that session willstay running. We can then “attach” to the session `tmux attach` and pick up where we leftoff.

##### The Command Prefix
< C - b >

##### Suspend tmux
suspend a session..to the background with `PREFIX C-z`

### Session Management


##### Creating a named session
`tmux new-session -s [name]`

##### Attach to a named session
`tmux attach -t [name]`

##### Detach from a session
`PREFIX d`

##### Kill a session
`tmux kill-session -t [name]`
OR
`:kill-session`

##### List all sessions 
`tmux ls`

### Window Management

##### Create a new window
`PREFIX c`

##### Renaming a window
`PREFIX ,`

##### Cycling between windows
`PREFIX n` or `PREFIX p`   [ next and previous]

`PREFIX w` is also great (ncurses)

##### Killing a window
`PREFIX &`



### Pane Management
##### Split Horizontally
`PREFIX "`

##### Split Vertically
`PREFIX %`

##### Cycle through panes
`PREFIX Spacebar`

##### killing a pane
`PREFIX x`

##### Resize all panes
`:select-layout tiled`
`:select-layout even-horizontal`
`:select-layout even-vertical`
`:select-layout main-horizontal`
`:select-layout main-vertical`

##### Zoom into a pane 
`PREFIX z`

##### Send keys to all the panes in a window
Write once to the pane you want to send keys to and then write the keys you want to send to all the other panes in that window.
`:setw synchronize-panes on`
..later,
`:setw synchronize-panes off`

```
Ctrl-b q Show pane numbers (used to switch between panes)
Ctrl-b o Switch to the next pane
Ctrl-b ? List all keybindings
```
### moving between windows
Ctrl-b n (Move to the next window)
Ctrl-b p (Move to the previous window)
Ctrl-b l (Move to the previously selected window)
Ctrl-b w (List all windows / window numbers)
Ctrl-b window number (Move to the specified window number, the
default bindings are from 0 -- 9)

Ctrl-b % (Split the window vertically)
CTRL-b " (Split window horizontally)
Ctrl-b o (Goto next pane)
Ctrl-b q (Show pane numbers, when the numbers show up type the key to go to that pane)
Ctrl-b { (Move the current pane left)
Ctrl-b } (Move the current pane right)

### Make a pane its own window
Ctrl-b : "break-pane"

### add to ~/.tmux.conf
bind | split-window -h
bind - split-window -v
