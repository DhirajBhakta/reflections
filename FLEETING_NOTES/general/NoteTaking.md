The goal is to build a latticework of knowledge, bottom up, tagged, not grouped under topics and subtopics, but each of them are at the same level, interconnected by links and backlinks

To practice learning NOT as a pure accumulation of knowledge, but as an attempt to build up a latticework of theories and mental models to which information can stick...

### The Problem
What is the usual way of taking notes?
-  underlining
-  writing into margins
-  writing into notebooks, papers
Working like this will leave you with a lot of different notes in different places. You will have to remember where and when these notes were written down

"Under which topic do I store this note?" this is top down approach.
If you sort by topic, you will add more and more notes to the same topic, or worse, create N levels of subtopics. 

"Writing everything down and not refining it". This will put everything in "permanent notes" category and you will fail to build a CRITICAL MASS of ideas. The knowledge is diluted due to insignificance of all other notes. You will have a bookshelf full of notebooks of ideas , but nothing useful out of all this.

Writing is the best facilitator for thinking, reading, learning, understanding and generating ideas. If you want to learn something for the long run, you have to write it down. If you want to understanding something, you have to write it in your own words. If you anyways have to write so much, why not use writing to build up the resources for future publications and ideas?

Why not build a knowledge base?
Our ability of store isolated facts reduces with age. But not the ability to remember interconnected information. "Latticework of mental models" makes it easier to learn, remeber and retrieve the info with context.

Planning is counterproductive. Planning restricts flow state. When you have a great organisation system, with interconnected knowledge items, you dont ever lose sight of the big picture and you can trust the system to always keep you on track...and instead focus on the tasks at hand. You dont need to be constrained with planning. You dont need to be chained by plans which force you to do something at a given time and given day. What you instead need, is a massively organised system of knowledge which are so interconnected that you can jump back and forth between ideas and never get bored. Any topic you pick would be densely connected to others and hence, interesting.

Even hard work can be fun as long as it is aligned with our intrinsic goals and we feel in control. The problems arise when we setup our work in such an inflexible way that we cant adjust it when things change and become arrested in the proces. To feel in control, you should first have immense flexibility in choosing to do whatever you want at any given time (to jump between topics if you are bored), and to do this, you need good organisation workflows which have uptodate context of where you left off ...

Motivation, will power is limited, and gets depleted. BUT NOT if the work/task itself is so engaging that it requires NO will power, NO motivation. Such a scenario can only occur when we feel we are in total control of the "next" task, truly autonomous. We need such flexibility in changing course with what seems interesting at the moment, and not stick to a "plan".. . No plan = enormous learnings in random direction = infinite energy to keep going = no procrastination.

**Take it for granted that YOU WILL find new or better topics to work on in the MIDDLE of working on a given topic** and this is perfectly okay!!

Luhmann, a nobody, spent his evenings reading up a lot of things, making organised notes, and became a professor of sociology with no academic qualifications, and published groundbreaking publications and articles...all by linking various trains of throught carefully organised in his "slip box".


### "Nothing counts other than writing" - mentality
Benefits of doing things with a clear purpose of writing about it...
- You will become more focussed on what you read because youre constantly judging if the piece is WORTH putting into your notes or not
- 
- You will read in a more engaged way. Because you are now forced to rephrase and write in your words and hence forced to understand what you read
- You will think beyond the material because you have to come up with something new in your notes

How ?

![[Pasted image 20230327023733.png]]
- Make fleeting notes. Process them later. These will be discarded later.
- Make permanent notes. ONE IDEA PER NOTE..force to be as brief and precise as possible...
	- one note per idea
	- one note per every new questions generated ...
	- **precise**, clear, and brief
- This note must be LINKED somehow
	- link it from an "index" note which serves as an entry point to it and related notes
	- without linking, this will just be a naive collection of notes. LINKING is what makes this system useful.
	- include backlinks as well.
- (extra) Tips for linking... to spawn connections and new ideas
	- NORTH: where did the idea come from?
	- WEST: what other ideas can this be related to?
	- EAST: what other ideas can this be competing with?
	- SOUTH: what implications does this idea have? Where does this lead me to?
- Stress on notes being very small and to the point, omit useless words..
- Notes are all BOTTOM-UP.
- This approach should trigger questions..
	- why?
	- what does it mean? how does it connect to ...?
	- what is the difference between ...?
	- what is this similar to ...?
	- ...

Dunning-Kruger effect: The more you know, the less confident you feel..and vice versa.

Zeigarnik effect: Open tasks tend to occupy our short term memory - until they are done. This is why we get so easily distracted by thoughts of unfinished tasks, regardless of their importance. We dont have to actually finish the tasks to stop thinking about them. All we have to do is to write them down in a way that convinces us that it will be taken care of.

Confirmation bias: Our temptation to like things which are agreement with things we already know/are in favor of.

Feynman technique: Explain a topic like youre teaching a 5 year old. 
We <u>tend to assume that we understood everything when we read something.</u>  We dont really test that assumption. Writing notes will force us to _really_ understand things we read since we need to rephrase the text. Most successful learning method is elaboration.
