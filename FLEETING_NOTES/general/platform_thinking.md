## What is a platform
- the "stored value" in the platform should get richer and richer with more and more interactions.
eg: 
    - StackOverflow
    - Quora
    - Github
- The accumulated "stored value" reaps exponential benefits with time.




## Platform and its interactions
- Platform is <u>nothing without the interactions</u> with outside systems.
- Platform becomes "richer and richer" with those interactions.
- Overtime, the platform becomes more and more valuable due to the accumulated interactions.
- What is the value out of the interactions
- How can the value be measured
- your "economics" comes from the stored value - which comes from the accumulated interactions.
- so first step would be to try to increase your interactions.
