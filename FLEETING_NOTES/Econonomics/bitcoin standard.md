# The Bitcoin Standard - the decentralized alternative to central banking
Bitcoin .. a distributed s/w that allows for transfer of value using a currency protected from
**unexpected inflation** without relying on trusted third parties.

Bitcoin automates the function of a modern central bank and makes them predictable and immutable by 
programming them into code decentralized among thousands of n/w members, none of whom can alter the
code without the consent of the rest.
### In Brief:
- 1st part: explains money, its function and properties.. lil bit of history. What makes for sound and unsound money.
- 2nd part: individual, social, global implications of sound and unsound money throughout history.
- 3rd part: How Bitcoin works, ..possible uses of bitcoin as a form of sound money. Use cases where bitcoin does not serve well,...addressing common misconceptions on bitcoin.

### Warnings 
While bitcoin's rise in market value may make it appear like a no-brainer as an investment, a closer 
look at myriad hacks, attacks, scams and security failures that have cost people their bitcoins...
provides a sobering warning to anyone who thinks that owning bitcoins provides guaranteed profit.

If you are convinced about bitcoins, your first investment should not be in buying bitcoins, 
but in time spent understanding how to buy, store and own bitcoins **securely**.

## Ch-1: Money
- The Problem:  "_How to move economic value across time and space?_"
- Solution 1: Barter
	- not scalable
	- relies on **Coincidence of Wants**.
		- What you want is produced by someone who doesnt want what you have to sell.
	- relies on **Coincidence of Scales**
		- What you want may not be equal in value to what you have
		- Dividing a commodity into smaller units may not  be practical.
	- relies on **Coincidence of time frames**
		- What you want to sell may be perishable . but what you want to buy is more durable.
		- Making it hard to accumulate enough of your perishable good to exchange for the durable good.
	- relies on **Coincidence of locations**
	- requires personal contact with the people you are trading with. I cant sit behind a PC in Delhi and trade bananas for pigs with a guy in Toronto.
- Solution 2: Indirect Exchange
	- Say person X has what you want, call it A
	- person X apparently wants a commodity B , but all you have is E to sell.
	- You will now have to find another person Y, who has B and is willing to exchange it with you for E.
	- Now that you have something that person X wants, i.e B, you can approach person X and exchange it with A.
	- Fucking dogshit crazy!
	- Not scalable
	- Soon, the system will find its equilibrium... people will find a set of commodities which will act as the medium of exchange. 
	- A good that assumes the role of a widely accepted medium of exchange is called money.

### Money
Money is a good purchased not to be consumed, nor to be employed in the production of other goods, 
but primarily for the sake of being exchanged for other goods.

Throughout human history, many things have served the function of money
- Gold and Silver
- Copper
- Seashells
- large stones
- salt
- cattle
- government paper
- precious stones
- alcohol and cigarettes. lol

### Salability of money

**Salability**:  The ease with which a good can be sold on the market whenever its holder desires, with
the least loss in its price.

The relative salability of goods can be assessed in terms of how well they address the 3 problems
- lack of coincidence of wants
- lack of coincidence of scales
- lack of coincidence of time frames (Most important)
- lack of coincidence of locations

Will the good hold value in future? will it just rot by its nature? For a good to be salable across time, it has to be immune to rot, corrosion, and other types of deterioration.

Physcial integrity through time, is a necessary but insufficient condition for salability across time...it is possible for a good to lose its value significantly even if its physical condition remains unchanged. Say its supply is drastically increased... then the good will lose its value.
<u>A common characteristic of forms of money throughout history is the presence of some mechanism to restrain the production of new units of the good to maintain the value of the existing units</u>
The relative difficulty of producing new units determines the hardness of money. Money whose supply is hard to increase is hard money.

### The stock/flow ratio

- stock: existing quantities/units 
- flow : extra productions that can be made

Hard money = high stock/flow ratio
Stupid money = low stock/flow ratio

If people choose a hard money, with high stock/flow ratio, as a store of value, their purchasing of it to store it would **increase the demand** for it, causing a rise in its price, which would incentivize its producers to make more of it. But because the flow is small compared to the existing supply, even a large increase in the new production is unlikely to depress the price significantly.

**Easy Money Trap**: Anything used as a store of value will have its supply increased, and anything whose supply can be easily increased will destroy the wealth of those who used it as a store of value.

Corollary: Anything that is successfully used as money will have some natural or artificial mechanism that restricts the new flow of the good into the market, maintaining its value across time.

Seashells were used as money when they were hard to find, loose cigarettes are used as money in prisons because they are hard to procure or produce, and with national currencies, the lower the rate of increase of the supply, the more likely the currency is to be held by individuals and maintain its value over time. When modern tech made catching of seashells easy, societies that used them switched to metal or paper money, and when govt increases its currency's supply, its citizens shift to holding foreign currencies, gold or other assets....happens a lot in developing countries.

Free market monetary competition is ruthlessly effective at producing sound money, as it only allows those who choose the right money to maintain considerable wealth over time. 

### Acceptability
In addition to salability, there is yet another important factor  - acceptability. Anything thats highly acceptably by the masses is the one that eventually wins. Its kinda paradoxical, people like to join band wagons and choose something that is already chosen by the masses. There are hundreds of social networking platforms, hundreds of email protocols... but people choose Facebook...choose POP3/SMTP simply because its already widely accepted by the masses. 

### Benefits of single medium of exchange
 Having a single medium of exchange allows the size of the economy to grow as large as the number of people willing to use that medium of exchange.
- larger the economy, larger the opportunities for gains from exchange and specialization, and longer and more sophisticated the structure of production can become.
- In a smaller economy, say you are a fisherman, you will have primitive boats and nets to catch local fish.
- In a larger economy, you can now "invest" in improving your industry, by paying the engineers in currency, you can get a more powerful boat which can travel furthur, withstand storms, and catch rare valuable fish from further in the ocean.
- None of this would be possible without money playing the roles of medium of exchange to allow specialization.; store of value to create future-orientation and incentivize individuals to direct resources to investment instead of consumption.

### Important Questions...
- Why are markets crashing now all of a sudden?
	- is this a good buy and hold opportunity? stocks, NOT mutual funds.
	- Should I wait further?
- If stock market crashes, what are the possibilities that it will stay crashed for a decade?
	- What kind of factors can cause this?
	- If yes, what should be my strategy about the 30+Lacs in mutual funds currently?
- If stock market crashes, what is the guarantee that it will recover to original levels??
	- What factor is responsible for a stock market to recover?
- Who controls how much money to print?


## Ch-2: Primitive Moneys

### Rai stones of Yap Island.
[Rai stones of the Yap Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rai_stones) resembles the operation of Bitcoin

- Made of limestones
- The beauty and rarity of these stones made them desirable.
- Procuring them was very difficult
- Involved laborious process of quarrying, shipping on rafts/canoes.
- Such large stones were kept open in public places
- The owner was well known to all the people, and when he wanted to sell it, he would announce the new owner.
- No way of "stealing", as its ownership is known to everyone.
- **This system worked well for centuries, and even a milennia..possibly**
- These stones had a very hight stock/flow ratio...no matter how desirable they were, it was not easy for anyone to inflate the supply of stones by bringing in new rocks..
- Until...
- An American captain in 1871 was shipwrecked in Yap Island. He saw the coconuts there and wanted to buy them ...but the natives did not want foreign currency... The captain went back to his home, brought explosives and large boats, and produced Rai stones very quickly.... and offered them to the natives.
- end. of .story

### Aggy glass beads of West Africa

Similar story in Wester Africa - with aggry glass beads used as money for centuries just because they were precious in an area where glassmaking tech was expensive and not common. --> High stock/flow ratio.
Europeans plundered the area after buying precious resources of Africa for the beads they made in their home where it was pretty easy and cheap. Literal wealth transfer from Africans to Europeans happened because of this!...so much that the aggy beads later came to be known as "slave beads", for the role they played in fueling the slave trade of Africans to Europeans and North Americans

### Sea Shells
Similar story with the sea shells.

### Cattle and Salt
Similar story with cattle, but still being used for Dowry lol.

Similar story with salt. Since cattle cannot be divisible into smaller units, salt was preferred.
> The word "salary" is derived from "sal", the Latin word for salt. And the word pecuniary is derived from pecus, the Latin word for cattle.

A money that is easy to produce is no money at all, easy money does not make a society richer; it actually makes it poorer by placing all its hard-earned wealth for sale in exchange for something easy to produce.

## Ch-3: Monetary Metals

Gold , Silver and Copper.

Why Gold thrives and silver and copper collapsed.

### Problems:

	- Existence of 2-3 metals as monetary standard created economic problems from fluctuations of their values over time due to the ebbs of supply and demand, and created problems for owners of these coins.
	- Govt and counterfeiters reduced the precious metal content in these coins, causing their value to decline, by transferring a fraction of their purchasing power to the counterfeiters or the govt. The reduction in metal content of the coins compromised the purity and soundness of the money.


### 19th Century & the Gold Standard : Paper Money.

Development of modern banking, improved communication.... paper money was trusted, and was backed by gold in the treasuries of their banks and central banks.

The gold standard allowed for massive global capital accumulation and trade.

But, banks and govt could increase the supply of money beyong the qty of gold they had, devaluing the money and transferring part of its value from money's legitimate owners to the government and banks.

### Why Gold?

A good's **market demand** = demand for consuming or holding the good for its own sake.

A good's **monetary demand** = demand for a good as a medium of exchange and store of value.

Gold has very high stock/flow ratio. 

### Anatomy of Market bubble.. 

Anytime a person chooses a good as a store of value, she is effectively increasing the demand for it beyong the regular market demand, which will cause its price to rise

Example: 

- Global copper market is valued at $100billion. With market demand at 20 million tons per year, at a price of $5000 per ton..
- _Say a billionaire decided to store $10billion of his wealth in copper._
- His bankers will now run around trying to buy 10% of annual global copper production, and eventually drive up the price of copper.
- The copper that he wants to buy already appreciates before the purchase is even complete... But this increase in price will cause more people to buy more copper as a store of value, driving the prices even higher.
- ...trouble.
- Copper on earth is nearly infinite, i mean a lot!!
- The rising prices make copper a lucrative business for workers across the world. The more labour you dedicate to this, the more copper you can extract... More copper can always be made with a higher price, and the price and qty will continue to rise until ....the investors demand is satisfied.
- Assume investors are satisfied at 10 million extra tons at $10000 per ton.
- At some point, the monetary demand must subside, and some holders of copper will want to sell..to purchase other goods...because thats the whole point of buying copper.
- Copper market goes back to its orginal supply-demand conditions, with 20 million annual tons selling for $5000 per ton.
- But as sell off happens, price will drop significantly below that...and the billionaire would have lost his money in the process...people who bought and stored copper at higher prices will suffer even more losses.



This model is applicable for all consumable commodities like copper, zinc, nickel, brass, oil which are primarily consumed ,not stockpiled. Global stockpiles of these commodities at any moment in time are around the same order of magnitude as new annual production... New supply is constantly being  generated to be consumed. If savers decide to store their wealth in such commodities.. they can only attempt to buy only a fraction of the global supply...=> demand increases...=> price shoots up...because they are competing with the consumers of this commodity who use it productively in the industry. Now the copper/whatever extractors/miners get richer, they can now invest in increasing the production....stock/flow ratio drops...price of copper/whatever crashes...robbing the savers of their wealth. <u>The Net effect of this entire cycle is the transfer of wealth from the misguided savers to the producers/extractors/miners of the commodity they purchased</u>

**Market Bubble** : increased demand => prices rise => further drives up the demand ==> prices shoot up even more ===> incentivizes the production of the commodity ====> stock/flow ratio drops =====> prices crash. +++-> Investors fleeced, producers of the asset benefit.

<u>History has consistently punished those who choose these commodities as money , returning the commodity to its natural role as a market good, and not a medium of exchange.</u>


For anything to function as a good store of value, hardmoney,..it has to beat this trap. <u>It has to appreciate when people demand it as a store of value, but its producers have to be contrained from inflating the supply significantly enough to bring the price down</u>

Clear winner :  **GOLD**

existing stockpile of gold held by all people everywhere is a product of thousands of years of gold production, and is orders of magnitude larger than new annual production. in 2006, gold price hiked by 36%. For any other commodity, this would be expected to increase mining output significantly to flood markets and bring the price down. Instead, annual production in 2006 was 100 tons less than in 2005. Even a 35% rise in prise can lead to no appreciable increase in the supply of new gold onto the market!

### Copper -> Silver --> Gold

As the production of metals began to proliferate, ancient civilizations in China, India, and Egypt began to use copper, and later Silver as money...as these two were relatively hard to manufacture at the time, and allowed good salability across time and space.

Gold was highly prized in these civilizations, but was too rare to be salable., transactions involving gold was limited.

**It was in Greece**, the birthplace of modern civilization, where gold was first minted into regular coins for trade, under king Croesus.

### Roman Golden Age & Decline

Romans conquered the greeks, but ironically greek culture conquered the roman population. And so did the culture of gold coins..

Rome had **denarius** (3.9 grams silver coin) as the de-facto money. Meanwhile gold was getting valuable and widespread in surrounding civilized areas, i.e Greece & co. Julius Caesar created the **aureus** coin (8g Gold), and was accepted rather quickly. ... Economic stability...Julius assasinated --> Augustus ---> then Nero.

#### The Debasement & the collapse....

[LEARN ABOUT DEBASEMENET IN INVESTOPEDIA](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debasement.asp)
Nero was the first to do "coin clipping" : where he collected gold coins from people and mixed other metals and reduced gold content.. what a bastard.

- Rome continued conquering newer prosperous lands with significant wealth
- emperors and soldiers lavishly spent the wealth
- emperors tried to make themselves popular by granting grains, staples and stupid low prices....and even for free!
- People stopped working. Many even migrated to Rome for "better life".
- Ever increasing lavish lifestyle...
- No more "prosperous" lands to conquer....
- Military badly in need of more financing... Citizens have become lazy af.
- Smart Nero..devalued the coins, reducing the metal content. and now you have More coins! more money! financing your lavish lifestyle and military!
	- denarius: 3.9g ---> 3.41g silver
	- aureus  : 8g -----> 7.2g gold.
- This gave temporary relief
- But started a vicious , highly destructive self-reinforcing cycle of popular anger, price controls, coin debasement, and price hike, 
- Think about it, people are not fools.. they DO notice that the new coins look ODD. so if you have 5 coins, and one coin looks bright and shiny, and rest 4 look dull ( but all of them have "equal value" according to Nero and govt), the people are bound to keep the shiny coins to themselves and let only the dull coins circulate in the economy..Shiny coins completely disappeared from existence.."Gresham's law" took effect. (Bad money drives out good money)
- Nero died...Caracalla came...further debased the coins 6.5g gold
- Caracalla died..Diocletian came..furthur debased the coins 5.5g gold
- He got rid of the aureus and introduced "solidus" with only 4.5g gold.
- end of denarius.
- Inflation rose in coming centuries.
- Failed attempts at placing price controls on basic goods. failed attempts at hiding inflation by Emperors.
	- from 98-95% gold/silver content to frikkin 2% content.
	- debasement = inflation. Why? By debasing, the emperor is actually pumping more money into the system or "creating coins out of nothing"..more the coins, more the inflation. Debasing gives more money to the govt for spending, but results in inflation to the general public.
	- These ridiculous debasements forced market forces to adjust prices upward... but there were ceilings created by emperors to control inflation
	- Producers of these goods were like fck this shit its no more profitable to make these goods.
- Economic production came to a standstill..
- fall in the value of money --> overspending by kings --> further debasing by misguided future kings ---> inflation and economic crisis.
- taxes increased and inflation made price control impossible, citizens fled away where they could live alone without paying tax
- Rome crumbled, citizens became self-sufficient peasants scattered in isolation, lived under small feudal lords.

### Byzantium and the Bezant

- Emperor  Constantine took over and was economically responsible, reversed the situation...
- committed to maintaining the solidus at 4.5g of gold without debasing and minted it in large quantities.
- solidus became the longest serving hard sound currency in human history
- Rome collapsed in ~500AD and Byzantian empire under Constantine thrived.
- But Constantine's successors did the same foolish stuff and debased the coin and led to the fall of their empire too
- The bezant(or solidus) inspired the Islamic Dinar which is in use even now .

> The  word "dinar" comes from denarius

Seventeen centuries of people over the world have used this coin, emphasising the salability of gold across time.

### The Renaissance

- Economic + military collapse of Rome ---> feudalism took over.
- Gold was concentrated in the hands of feudal lords, and public was allowed to circulate debasable copper and silver coins.
- No peasant was born with "wealth" inheritance and debasing and inflation eroded people's wealth quickly, forcing them to always stay in poverty.
- With renaissance, which began in city of Florence, Italy... the new coin "florin", the first major European sound coinage since Julius Caesar's aureus. Florence's rise made it the commercial centre of Europe, with florin as the prime medium of exchange. 
- Venice followed suit, and introduced "ducat" coin with same specifications as the florin.
- 150 other European cities followed suit,  and had minted respective coins of same specs.
- People flourished. Wealth could now be accumulated and passed on to generations..

Rome, Constantinople, Florence, Venice...show that a sound monetary standard is necessary prerequisite for humans to flourish., without which the society will face barbarism and destruction.

### Paper Money

- Europe story not yet done...
- Feudal lords were cunning, did some debasing here and there.
- Gold and silver both were used in the markets as coins..Silver's lower value per unit weight made it easily divisible into quantities suitable for smaller transactions.
- This caused confusion regarding  rate of exchange between gold and silver coins. Caused trade calculation problems ...
- Invention of telegraph in 1837 and network of trains brought a new wind of change.
- It became easy for banks to communicate with each other , sending payments efficiently across space and **debiting accounts** instead of sending physical payments. <u> This led to the increased use of bills , checks and paper reciepts and monetary media instead of physical gold and silver coins </u>

### Britain & the Gold Standard 

More nations began to switch to a monetary standard of paper fully backed by and instantly redeemable into precious metals held in vaults.

Britain was the first to adopt a modern gold standard in 1717, as directed by **Isaac Newton**

The Economic supremacy of Britain was linked  to its being on a superior monetary standard, and other European countries followed suit.
People would now store their wealth as gold in banks, and use paer receipts, bills , checks to make payments of any size.
This would work as long as the banks holding people's gold would not increase the supply of papers they issued as reciepts.

### India & the Silver Standard...and its collapse

[See short history of the indian monetary standard](https://swarajyamag.com/economy/the-history-of-the-indian-monetary-standard)

With checks, bills and reciepts being backed by Gold in the vaults, allowing payment in whichever quantity or size.., there was no longer any role
for silver's role in small payments.
More and more countries joined the gold standard, leading to nations who used silver to witness a progressive loss of their purchasing power and a 
stronger incentive to shift to gold.

There was no more justification to silver's monetary role, nations and individuals shifted to holding gold, ...significant  collapse of price of silver, which did not recover. Demonetisation of silver had bad impact on nations still using it as a monetary standard at that time. India witnessed a continuous devaluation of its rupee compared to gold based European countries, which led the British colonial govt  to increase taxes to finance its operation, leading to growing unrest in India. By the time India shifed to gold std in 1898, the silver backing its rupee, had lost 56% of its value in 27 years. China which stayed on the silver standard , lost 78% of its value.

The History of India & China, the failure to catch up to the West during the twenthieth CE, is linked to this massive destruction of wealth and captial  brought about by the demonetization of the monetary metal that these countries used. <u>India and China were in a situation very similar to west Africans holding aggri glass beads as Europeans arrived:; Domestic hard money(silver backed) was easy money for foreigners, and was being driven out by foreign hard money, which allowed foreigners to control and own increasing quantities of the resources that India and China had..</u>

<u>History shows that it is impossible to insulate yourself from the consequences of others holding money that is harder than yours</u>


### the curse of Centralization

With gold in the hands of increasingly centralized banks, it DID gain salability across times, scales and location..but lost its property as cash money, making payment in it ..subject to the agreement of the financial and political authorities issuing reciepts, clearing checks, and hoarding the gold.

Sadly, the ONLY way gold could be salable across time, scale and location was by being centralized ....and thus falling prey to the major problem of sound money in 20th century: individual control over money and its resistance to govt centralized control..

Notice that early economists focused on "sound money" as money that is salable across time, scale and location....but modern economists focus on "sound money" as something which cannot be controlled by a central authority

"Wealth cannot be generated by tampering wih money supply" - but central banks payed no heed and went on printing money unbacked by gold.. People with their pockets full of money payed no heed to unsound money. "One cannot make all people richer by printing money"... Centralization of the gold reserves allowed these govts to expand the money supply beyond their gold reserves... reducing the value of their currency...this is when the USDollar global standard began...Gold was demonetized fully in 1971


## Ch-4 Government Money

Govt money = **Fiat Money**

There is very large difference b/w govt money redeemable in gold, and irredeemable govt money ..even if both are run by govt.

Majority of the countries maintain some gold in their reserves, and those countries which do not have gold reserves..maintin reserves in the form of other countries' fiat currencies..which are in turn backed by gold reserves.
No pure fiat currency exists in circulation without any form of backing. It is by holding gold that govts could get their fiat money to be accepted by all.

### First Fiat currency - jiaozi, and its fall.

Oldest recorded fiat money was "jiaozi", a paper currency issued by Song dynasty in China...10CE AD. Initially it was a receipt for gold/silver...but then the govt controlled its issuance and suspended redeemability, increasing the printed money, until it collapsed.

The "chao" currency of Yuan dynasty had a similar fate, exceeded the printed money supply far beyond the metal backing, and collapsed.

Govt's fiat money is then very similar to primitive money like aggy glass beads or rau stones. It is prone to having its supply increased quickly compared to its stock...=>stock/flow ratio decreases ...=> leading to quick loss of its salability, destruction of purchasing power, and impoverishment of its holders. In this respect, fiat money differs from gold, whose supply cannot be increased due to the fundamental chemical properties of the metal.

### World War 1

When the govts were on a gold std, they had direct control of large vaults of gold while their people where dealing with paper receipts of this gold.It was far too tempting to increase the money supply during conflicts and wars, far easier than demanding taxation from citizens. (Does Nero's debazing of aureus sound any bells?). For as long as govt could print more money and have that money accepted by its citizens and foreigners, it could keep financing the war.

Had the govts remained on the gold standard, or had the people of Europe held their own gold in their own hands, forcing govt to resort to taxation instead of inflation, world war 1 would have been settled within just a few months of conflict, as the countries would run out of financing nad face trouble getting taxes from already poor citizens, the govt would fall. But this did not happen, a bloody stalemate continued for years, with no resolution or advancement. 

After the war ended, currencies of major European powers had declined in real value, thanks to money being printed to finance the war. All countries had gone off gold (because they printed far more money than that can be backed by gold) and gold std was no longer functional. Now there was a huge dilemma, should the govt turn back to the gold std and admit shamelessly how much their currency has fallen compared to 4 years ago before the war? hell no.. the citizens would demand to have gold back into their own hands and sell it to other countries where its valued higher. Instead of market participants freely choosing the most salable good as the medium of exchange, ...the value, supply, and interest rate for fiat money now became centrally planned by the national govts = "Monetary Nationalism".

Germany suffered from HyperInflation after the Treaty of Versailles had imposed HUGE penalties and fine for war reparations on the country, ...and lol Germany tried to repay them with more inflation

The first major treaty of the century of monetary nationalism was 1922 Treaty of Genoa - USDollar and British Pound were to be considered reserve currencies equivalent to gold in other countries' reserves. UK hoped that this would force other countries to buy large qtys of British Pound to store in their reserves... Many many countries moved away from gold std --> to inflation as a solution to problems. Britain's gold sadly continued to flow to America and France...Watch [Lords of Finance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wl30rHVAtI) which talks of the drain of gold from Britain. The Biggest problem was that governments wanted to return to gold standard at pre-war rates...which is impossible. Brtian's gold reserves were leaving its shores to places where it was better valued... To counter this..
- The chief of Bank of England tried to convince his "friends" in France, Germany and America to pump more money into their respective countries... (which would devalue their paper currency) hoping that the gold outflow would stop..... but the French, German "friends" were not cooperative.
- Next, the chairman of New York Federal Reserve, engaged in inflationary policies in 1920s. This might have reduced the outflow of Gold from Britain....BUT, this caused a major bubble in housing and stock market in US --> 1929 stock market crash --> longest depression in America. "The Great Depression".  US recovery started only after Roosevelt dropped the gold standard.

### America's Great Depression.

"Inflation does wonderful things..."

In a move to slightly help Britain keep its gold reserve and stop outflow of gold from british shores, more USD was pumped in America...resulting in inflation...--> rise in prices and wages...--> people wanting more and more goods which they couldnt affort ---> people jumping to stock market to make quick bucks --> more and more speculation in stock market ---> people even bought stocks on "margin" paying only 10% of the stocks value because they cannot afford...and then losing the stock AND paying debt when the stock crashed in value....--->1929 the stock market crashed heavily. Brtian's gold reserves were leaving its shores to places where it was better valued... To counter this..

NOW, to add to this, Hoover the President of USA tried to keep wages high to pre crash times and prices also high to pre crash times. Unemployment started as companies could not afford such high rates, farmers even burned their crop (in case of excess) to keep the price high...led to failure of production.. just like during the time of Nero.

None of this would have happened with sound money, and only through inflation did all this happen.

After the crash, they should have bitten the bullet and revalued the dollar to gold at market determined price and let wages and prices adjust freely. Instead of learning that lesson, the govt economists decided that the fault was not in inflation, but rather in the gold standard which restricts inflation. Roosevelt banned gold, even private ownership of gold, forcing citizens to sell their gold to US Treasury at $20 per ounce. Roosevelt THEN revalued the dollar from $20 per sounce to $35 per ounce. This was the inevitable reality of years of inflation which started from 1914 war days

It was the abandonment of sound money and its replacement with govt issued fiat which turned leading economies into centrally planned failures.

The Gold standard which produced more than 4 decades of uninterrupted global growth  and prosperity between 1870 and 1914 suddenly stopped working in 1930s because it would not allow govt to expand money supply to fight depression. If the problem was indeed the gold standard, then its suspension should have caused recover. But it took more than 10 years for recovery to start after suspension of the gold std.

### Bretton Woods - New Global trading system.

The United States was to be the center of global monetary system, while its dollars being used as global reserve currency by other central banks, whose currencies would be convertible to gold at a fixed exchange rate, while dollar itself would be convertible to gold at a fixed exchange rate. To facilitate this system, US would take gold from other countries' central banks. This was like the entire world economy was being run as one country on a gold standard, with US Federal Reserve acting as the world's central bank and all of the world's central banks as regional banks,...but the main difference was that the monetary discipline of the gold standard was completely lost here, where there was no effective controls on all central banks in expanding money supply, because no citizen could redeem their govt fiat money for gold. 

Now US could purchase whatever it wanted from the world, and finance it through debt monetized by inflating the currency that the entire world used!!

Bretton Woods conference established IMF. International Monetary Fund, which acted as the global coordination body b/w central banks.

### Fucking Nixon

The world realized the diminishing purchasing power of the USD ( it was getting devalued continuously thanks to US printing more and more money to finance its royal needs of its people and govt , the world paid the fucking price. The cost of inflation was distributed to the entire world! ). The Frech even sent a military to repatriate their gold. Germans tried to do the same, and Nixon stepped in and <u>Announced the end of dollar convertability to gold</u> The US had now defaulted on its commitment to redeem its dollars to gold.

The US printed its notes on a large scale and there was a large drop in purchasing power of the dollar.

Nixon completed what world war 1 started...transforming the world economy from a global gold std to a standard based on several govt issued currencies.  To get an idea of how much money was printed, 1 ounce of gold was worth $35 in 1971, and today it is worth more than $1200

### Hyperinflation in Developing countries.

Developed countries had slower increases in the supply of their currencies than developing countries, which witnessed faster price hikes and several hyperinflationary episodes (upto quadruple digits in percentage!)

Even for developed countries, growth at 5% per year may not sound like much, but it will double the money supply of a country in only 15 years.

Hyperinflation never happened with economies that operated on gold standard or even silver std or even  seashells and beads which lost their monetary role over time very very slowly, with replacements taking over more and more of the purchasing power of the disappearing currency..BUT, with govt fiat money, its very possible for an entire society to witness all its savings in the form of money disappear in the space of few months or even weeks.

Hyperinflation is far more disastrous than just the loss of a lot of economic value by a lot of people. It constitutes a complete breakdown of the structure of economic production of a society built up over centuries and milennia. With collapse of money, it gets impossible to trade, produce, or engage in anything other than scraping for the bare essentials of life. As the structures of production and trade that soceities have developed over centures break down due to the inability of the consumers, producers and workers to pay one another, goods which humans take for granted begin to disappear.

<u> The Problem with govt fiat money is that its hardness depends entirely on the ability of those in charge to NOT inflate its supply</u>History has shown that govts will inevitably succumb to the temptation of inflating money supply....govt will always find a reason to print more money, expanding govt power while reducing the wealth of the currency holders. This is no different from copper miners mining more copper in response to monetary demand for copper; it rewards the producers of the monetary goood, but punishes those who choose to put their savings in copper.

### Government creep

As the world moves towards reducing reliance on cash (and towards digital money),  more of people's money is being placed in govt supervised banks, making it vulnerable to confiscation or capital controls. The fact that these procedures generally happen during times of economic crises, when people need that money most, is a major concern over the salability of govt issued money.

### Sound Money?

Sound money is what the market freely chooses to be money, and what remains under the control of its owner/earner, safe from coercive meddling and intervention. For as long as the money was controlled by anyone other than the owner, whoever controlled it would always face too strong an incentive to rob the money of its purchasing power via inflation of confiscation, and use it as a political tool to achieve political goals at the expense of the holders. This , in effect , takes wealth away from the people who earn it...and gives it to people who specialize in the control of money without actually producing things valued by the society,...in the same way European traders/sailors could rob the African society by flooding them with cheap glass aggy beads...

Friedrich Hayek says... (1984)
> I don't believe we shall ever have a good money again before we take the thing out of the hands of governement., that is, we can't take it violently  out of the hands of the governement, all we can do is by some sly roundabout way introduce something that they cannot stop



## Ch-5 Money & Time Preference.

**Time Preference** :Ratio  at which individuals value the present compared to the future.

Animals have very high time preference, they think only about the present and never about the future(exclude ants , bees). Civilized humans have very low time preference as they tend to worry about the future and "invest" for the future.

### "Investment"

Not only does investment require delaying gratification, it also carries with it a risk of failure, which means the investment will only be 
undertaken with an expectation of a reward.

### When is a civilization initiated?

>  Once the time preference drops enough to allow for any savings and capital or durable consumer goods formation at all, the tendency 
is for time preference to drop even furthur as a "process of civilization" is initiated.

A society in which individuals bequeath their children more than what they received from their parents is a civilized society: it is a place where life is improving, and people live with a purpose of making the next generation's lives better. As society's capital levels continue to increase, productivity increases and along with it, the quality of life. 

### Monetary Inflation

It has been observed that gold's purchasing power has not changed for centuries. But when the gold backing was removed after World Wars, and after Nixon's declaration...the prices of goods shot up w.r.t fiat currency like USDollar, and the value of gold increased. But Purchasing power of gold remained the same. You could buy X kilograms of wheat for 1g of gold now ....you could buy X kilograms of wheat for 1g of gold 300 years ago . ( It actually is -> 0.8g of gold could buy X kilograms of wheat...because gold appreciated in value when USD depreciated. )

However this applies only to wholesale items like wheat and oil and wine. Most items that we consume have appreciated in value, you cannot compare cars of 1900 to cars of today. Items whose "consumable" value have actually increased will obviously demand higher price ( even without inflation )


### Saving and Capital Accumulation

Given the choice b/w the same good today or in the future, any sane person would prefer to have it today. Only by increasing the return in the future will people consider delaying gratification.

Sound money is money that gains in value slightly over time, meaning that holding on to it is likely to offer an increase in purchasing power (holding it in your home, not bank). Unsound money being controlled by central banks whose express mission is to keep inflation positive, will offer little incentive for holders to keep it.
<u>
For unsound money, as increases in money supply effectively means low interest rates, the incentive to save and invest is diminished, while the incentive to borow increases
</u>

While savings rate have plummeted across the globe, indebtedness continues to rise. Average household in the Westg is indebted by more than 100% of 
its annual income. The total debt burden of government exceeds GDP by multiples...

> "Debt is good for growth, and savings would result in recession." - keynesian economists

Keynesians argue that "National Debt does not matter, since we owe it to ourselves" lol. This "ourselves" is nothing but us in current and future generations, current ones which consume recklessly at the expense of future ones.

Keynes just care about spending. "Spending is all that matters", "we should borrow from the future to invest in our future". They say that by delaying consumption by saving, it will put workers out of work and cause economic production to stall.

The reduced incentive to save is mirrored with increased incentive to spend, and with interest rates regularly manipulated downwards and banks able to issue more credit than ever, lending stopped being restricted to investment, but has moved on to consumption! Credit cards and consumer loans allow individuals to borrow for the sake of consumption without even the pretense of performing investment in the future. This is NOT capitalism! Capitalism is when people drop their time preference, defer immediate gratification, and invest in the future.Yeah they can borrow, BUT NOT TO CONSUME IMMEDIATELY, but to invest into the future!

THE only cause of economic growth is delayed gratification, saving and investment, which extend the length of production cycle and increase the productivity of methods of production, leading to better standards of living.


### Debt

> 100 years ago, most people would pay for their house, education, marriage form their own labor or accumulated savings.....such a notion seems ridiculous today. 

Debt is the opposite of saving. If saving creates the possibility of capital accumulation and civilizational advance, debt is what can reverse it, through reduction in capital stocks across generations, reduced productivity, and a decline in living standards...Debt will require ever higher taxes to refinance, the current generations may be the first in the world since the demise of Roman Empire and Industrial revolution to come into the world with less capital that their parents. Rather than witness their savings accumulate and raise the capital stock, this generation has to work to payoff the growing interest on its debt, working harder to fund entitlement programs they will barely get to enjoy while paying higher taxes and barely being able to save for their old age. This has led to several generations of accumulated wealth being squandered on conspicuous consumption within a generation or two, making indebteness a new method for funding major expenses.

<u>
When money was nationalized, it was placed under the command of politicians who operate over short time horizons of few years, trying their best to get re-elected. It was only natural that such a process would lead to short term decision making where politicinas abuse currency to fund their reelection campaigns at the expense of future generations
</u>
Central governmental control of money supply inevitably destroys incentives to save while increasing the incentive to borrow. 

### Reduced incentive for having a family

<u> No matter how prudent a person, his children will still witness their savings lose value and have to pay taxes to cover inflationary largesse of their government</u> The family's ability to finance the individual has been eclipsed by the state's largesse, resulting in a decline on inventive for maintaining a family. In a traditional society, individuals are aware that they will need children to support them in the future, and so will spend their healthy young years starting a family. But if long term investment is desincentivised, if saving is likely to be counterproductive as money depreciates, this investment on having a family becomes less profitable. Over time, the incentive to start a family declines and more and more people end up living single lives, more marriages are likely to break down as partners are less likely to put in the necessary emotional, moral and financial investment to make them work, while marriages that do survive, will likely produce less children or no children

### Decline in innovation

Total number of innovations rose in the twenthieth century, ut the number of innovations per capita had peaked in 19th CE. Our modern world was built in the gold std years preceding WW1

### Decline in art

Renaissance had the best art. Period.

People under sound money produced art and music that would require countless hours, so that their works could live on for centuries...



## Ch-6 Capitalism's Information System

[The use of knowledge in Society](https://www.kysq.org/docs/Hayek_45.pdf). This Paper by Hayek has inspired Jimmy Wales to create Wikipedia.

<u>
The Economic problem is not  merely the problem of allocating resources and products, but more accurately, the problem of allocating them using knowledge that is not given it its totality to any single individual or entity</u>

The Economic knowledge of the conditions of production, the relative availablity and abundance of factors of production, and preferences of individuals is not objective knowledge that can be fully known to a single entity. Rather, the knowledge of economic conditions is by its very nature **distributed** and situated with the peole concerned by their individual decisions..There is no way to centralize all knowledge into one decision maker's hand.

### Price
> "the price of a good has distilled knowledge about market conditions/economic conditions"

In a free market economic system, prices are knowledge, and the signals that communicate information. Each individual decision maker is only able to carry out her decisions by examining the prices of the goods involved, which carry in them the **distillation of all market conditions and realities into one actionable variable for that individual**.

Also, each individual's decisions will in turn play a role in shaping the price.

Few in the industry will be able to specialize in the industry and drive up the price of **their** brand's product, compared to other products in the same segment,...and re-invest that new accumulated capital into further specializing into their field.

### Capital Market Socialism

> Why would anyone work if everyone got the same incentive  regardless of effort??

Soviet Union is an example of Socialism where production etc is under the control of the government.

This centralization irritates the functioning of an actual market, making sound decisions based on price impossible. Without a market for capital where independant actors can bid for capital, there can be no price for capital or capital goods. Without prices, which reflecting their relative supply and demand, there is no rational way of determining the most productive uses of capital, no way to determine how much to produce for each good. 

### Free Market

In a free market, the buyer and seller are free to transact on terms determined by them solely, and where entry and exit into the market are free; no third parties can restrict sellers or buyers from entering the market; no third parties can stand to subsidize buyers and sellers who cannot transact in the market. 

No country in the world has a capital market that has these characteristics today.


### Loaning and Interest rate | debt

More the interest rate, more the people are inclined to save up and offer the savings to entreprenuers and firms

More the interest rate, lesser the willingness to borrow.

A society with a lot of individuals with low time preference is likely to have plenty of savings, bringing the interest rate down and providing 
for plenty of capital for firms to invest, generating significant economic growth for the future.

As society's time preference increases, people are less likely to save, interest rates rise,  producers find less capital to borrow.

> Interest rate in a nation reflected its cultural level: higher the people's intelligence and moral strength, the more they save and lower the interest rates.

But today, central banks determine the interest rates, and control the supply of loanable funds through a variety of monetary tools, operating through their control of the banking system.

<u>
A fundamental fact to understand about modern financial system : Banks create money whenever they engange in lending
</u>

Money supply and interest rates :
> When interest rates drop, there is an increase in lending, which leads to an increase in money creation and a rise in the money supply. Conversely, a rise in interest rates causes a reduction in lending and contraction in the money supply ( or atleast a reduction in the rate of its growth )

This is NOT possible in sound money, as you can borrow only that is deposited. You cannot create money our of nothing via lending.

### Price controls, it fails

Understand this; Should a govt decide to set the price of apples and prevent it from moving, the outcome will either be shortage or surplus

eg: When Nero and his successors debased the Aureus and denarius, they increased inflation...but also wanted to keep the prices from skyrocketing...so put price controls. Now the producers had NO profit because they could no longer afford the raw materials. so production comes to a standstill and there you have a shortage.

### Recession

Lower the interest ==> More and more producers borrow , operating under the delusion that the money will allow them to buy all the capital goods necessary for their production process. ==> As more and more producers are bidding for fewer raw materials than they expect there to be, ==> they drive up the prices of the raw materials ..This is the point at which the bubble is exposed. ==> Several projects suddenly become unprofitable at the new inflated prices of the raw materials...These projects are not completed, and become unnecessary waste of capital. ==> suspension of these projects at the same time causes a rise in unemployment across the economy ===> this economy-wide simultaneous failure of overextended businesses is called **recession**

The "Business Cycle" is the natural result of the manipulation of the interest rates(lowering) , distorting the market for capital by making investors imagine they can attain more capital than is available with the unsound money they have been offered at low interest rates from the banks.

Recessions are inevitable outcome of interest rate manipulation and shortages are the outcome of price ceilings.

Even if the central bank tries to stop the inflation by raising the interest rates, a recession follows as many projects that were started are exposed as unprofitable and have to be abandoned, exposing the misallocation of resources and capital that took place.

If the central bank were to continue its inflationary process indefinitely, it would just increase the scale of misallocations in the economy, wasting even more capital and making the inevitable recession even more painful.

It is believed that...
> Recessions are the result of the govt not responding quickly enough to financial crisis, bank run, and deflationary collapse by increaseing the money supply to re-inflate the banking sector
lol

**The only cause of an economy-wide recession is the inflation of the money supply**. 

**The more you try to solve depression with more inflation...the slower and more painful the recovery**


### Boom and Bust Cycle

This dysfunction is treated as normal part of market economics.

### Trade Barriers

In the eras of sound money, there was no need for trade barriers, or trade charges across countries.

When a country's exports grows larger than its imports (trade surplus), its currency appreciates,

When imports grow larger than exports, the currency depreciates,.

### Foreign Exchange
[See this](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/080613/effects-currency-fluctuations-economy.asp)
FX market is $1860 trillion per year. And Combined GDP of the world is $75 trillion per year. FX market is around 25 times larger than all the economic production that takes place on the entire planet. FX is NOT a productive process, which is why its volume is not counted in GDP stats, there is no economic value being created in transferring one currency to another; but it is a cost paid to overcome the large inconvenience of having different national currencies for different nations. 

This cripples the ability of global trade to benefit people, not only is the world wasting large amounts of capital and labor attempting to overcome these barriers...businesses and individuals worldwide incur significant losses.

Say you are in India and your business uses imported raw materials from France.. If France's currency appreciates suddenly, your business will incur losses bcos the raw materials are now costly af. Similarly if you export your products to Italy and their currency appreciates, your business will incur losses.

In a free market for economy, individuals would choose the currencies they want to use, and the result would be that the lowest stock/flow ratio currency would be chosen by the world. This currency would oscillate the least with changes in demand and supply, and it would become a globally sought medium of exchange, allowing all economic calculation to be carried out with it, becoming a common unit of measure across time and space.. This would at once create economic stability and free up a large amount of capital and resources to the production of valuable goods and services, rather than speculation on complex exchange rate oscillations.


## Ch-7 Sound Money and Individual Freedome

### Should govt manage the money supply?

The fundamental scam is the idea that govt needs to manage money supply.

^This has become the unquestioned starting assumption of all mainstream economic schools of thought and political parties. 

Every attempt to manage money supply has ended with economic disaster. 

Money supply is just like a drug; either suffer the withdrawal effects of caesing the addiction, or take another hit, delay the reckoning by a day, and sustain severe long term damage.

#### Keynes School of thought

Spending decides the economy. When society collectively spends a lot, the spending incentivizes producers to create more products, thus employing more workers and reaching full-employment equilibrium. If spending rises too much, beyond the capacity of producers to keep up, it would lead to inflation and a rise in the overall price level.

When society spends too little, producers reduce their production, firing workers and increasing unemployment, resulting in recession.

Recessions, for Keynes, are caused by abrupt reductions in the aggregate level of spending..

Keynes solution to recession: Whenever there is recession, or a rise in the unemployment level, the CAUSE of which is the drop in spending....the solution is for the government to stimulate more spending, which will in turn increase production and reduce unemployment. 

3 ways
- Increase money supply
- reduce taxes.

Seeing as it is hard to increase taxes during a recession, the only way out is to increase money supply.

**Whenever the economy was not at full employment, an increase of money supply would fix the problem.** There is no point worrying about inflation at this point because Keynes assumes that inflation only happens when spending is too high, and because unemployment is high, that means spending is too low. ...

BUT the reality is that high inflation AND high unemployment can occur at the same time.!


#### Monetarist School of thought

Milton Friedman

Monetarists oppose Keynesian efforts to spend money to eliminate unemployment, arguing that in the long run, the effect of unemployment will be eliminated, while causing inflation..Monetarists prefer tax cuts to stimulate the economy., because they argue that the free market will better allocate resources than government spending.
But the reality is that either tax cuts, or increased govt spending...both policies result in increased govt deficits which can only be financed with monetizing debt, effectively increasing money supply.

They believe that central banks must do all it can to ensure deflation never happens.

Should the central bank coontract money supply, or fail to expand it adequately, then a deflationary spiral can take place, which would discourage people from spending thier money and thus harm employment and cause economic downturn.

#### Austrian School of thought

Derives from the work of Classical Scottish, French, Spanish, Arab, Ancient Greek economists.

"Money" emerges in a market as the most marketable commodity, and most salable asset.

The absence of control by govt is a necessary condition for the soundness of money, seeing as govt will have the temptation to debase its money.

The quantity of money itself is irrelevant, and any supply of money is sufficient to run an economy of any size, because currency units are infinitely divisible, and because it is only the purchasing power of money in terms of real goods and services that matters, and not its numerical quantity.

A currency that appreciates in value incentivizes saving, as savings gain purchasing power over time. It hence encourages deferred consumption, resulting in lower time preference. 
A currency that depreciates in value, leaves citizens constantly searching for returns to beat inflation, returns that one must come with a risk, and so leads to an increase in investment in risky projects and an increased risk tolerance among investors leading to increased losses.
An economy with appreciating currency would witness investment only in projects that offer a positive real return over the rate of appreciation of money, meaning that only the projects expected to increase society's capital stock will tend to get funded. 
An economy with depreciating currency incentivizes people to invest in projects that offer positive returns in terms of depreciating currency, but negative real returns. 

### Unsound Money and Perpetual War

Unsound money is itself a trade barrier between countries, because it distorts value between countries and make trade flows a political issue, creating animosity and enmity between govts and populations. If there was no trade barriers, all businessmen would benefit from economies of scale, catering to people throughout the world with their products, which motivate them to specialize even more and get better, competing with firms across the globe. For price mechanism to work, prices need to be denominated in a sound form of money across the community that trades with it. The larger the area using a common currency,  the easier and larger the scope of trade within the area. Trade b/w people creates peaceful coexistence by giving them a vested interest iin each other's prosperity. When communities use different kinds of unsound money, trade becomes more complicated, as prices vary along with the variation in value of the currencies, making the terms of trade unpredictable, and making it often counterproductive to plan economic activity across borders.


Govt having access to printing money allow it to continue to fight until it completely destroys the value of its currency. With sound money, the govt war effort was limited by the taxes it could collect.

People dealing with sound money develop a lower time preference, allowing them to think more of cooperation rather than conflict.
Conflict is by its very nature destructive, and in most cases, intelligent and future-oriented people understand that there are no winners in violent conflict, because winners will most likely  suffer more losses than if they had just stayed away from war.  Civilized societies function on the premise that people respect one another's wills, and if there are conflicts they attempt a peaceful resolution. If a solution is not found, people are more likely to part ways and avoid each other than continue to agitate and remain in conflict. This explains why prosperous civilized societies generally dont witness crime violence or conflict.

### Democracy?

Democracy is a mass delusion of people attempting to violate the rules of economics by voting themselves a free lunch and being manipulated into 
violent tantrums against scapegoats whenever the bill for the free lunch arrives via inflation and recessions.

Unsound money is a boon to tyrant govts , which allows them to increase money supply to finance their undertakings first, and letting the population handle the consequences later as they witness their wealth and purchasing power evaporate.

In a sound money system, govt will need to tax before they spend. People can easily detect if the taxed money is being spent on productive purposes, upon which they will willingly give away their taxes. If they detect that govt is spending money on nonsense, they will just deny the tax...and govt will be overthrown.

### Mindless credit expansion

1920s - credit expanded like crazy --> people were full of money. For as long as credit keeps flowing, the victims are oblivious and the illusion of increased wealth is created across society as both the victim and the robber think they have the money. Credit creation by central banks causes unsustainable booms by allowing the financing of unprofitable projects and allowing them to coninue consuming resources on unproductive activities.

**Creative Destruction** : In a sound money system, any business that survives, does so by producing goods and services which have much higher value than the raw materials/inputs. Any firm that produces outputs valued at less than its inputs would go out of business, its resources freed up to be used by other more productive firms.

But in unsound money system, you can see so many useless firms alive just because the govt is keeping it afloat with printing more money. These firms are a burden on the society, eating away at the shortage of resources. Best examples are govt agencies themselves, look at hove incompetent its employees are. Do you think these agencies produce any value at all? Lebanon for eg, had a "Train Authority" long after trains were decommissioned and tracks rusted into oblivion.

in a society with sound money, a central bank would have to tax everyone not involved in the bank inorder to bail out the bank in crises. In a society with unsound money, the central bank is simply able to create new money supply and use it to support the bank's liquidity. 

Presence of central bank being able to bail out the banks creates a major problem of moral hazard for these banks, they can now take excessive risks knowing that the central bank will be inclined to bail them out to avert a systemic crises. From this, we see how banking has evolved into a business that generates returns without risks to bankers and simulataneously creates risks without returns for everyone else.

### 2 modes of payment

<u>
Cash transactions were confined to the physical realm of direct contact, while all digital forms of payment had to be supervised by a 3rd party
</u>

1. **Cash payment**
	- carried out in person
	- no need to worry about trust
	- no delay
	- no 3rd party
	- main drawback? need for the 2 parties to be physically present in the same place at the same time.

2. **Intermediated Payments**
	- needs "trusted" 3rd party
	- why? The danger of double-spending: there is no way of guaranteeing that the payer was being honest with his funds, and not using them more than once, unless there is a trusted third party overseeing the account, and is able to verify the integrity of the payments carried out.
	- cheques, credit cards, debit cards, bank wire transfers, money transfer services, paypal...
	- Need NOT be physically present in the same place at the same time.
	- "Trust" is a huge factor


<u>
Bitcoin : no need of a trusted 3rd party
</u>

Bitcoin is the first example of **digital cash**

### Bitcoin: first digital cash

Satoshi Nakamoto's motivation for Bitcoin was to create a purely peer-to-peer form of electronic cash, which would not require trust in 3rd parties for transactions and whose supply cannot be altered by any other party.


### Bitcoin: Mining

- Every transaction has to be recorded by every member of the network, so that they all share one common **ledger** of balances and transactions.
- Whenever a member of the network transfers a sum to another member, all network members can verify the sender has sufficient balance, and nodes compete to be the first to update the ledger with a new block of transactions every ten minutes.
- For a node to commit a block of transactions to the ledger, it has to expend processing power on solving complicated math problems that are hard to solve, but whose correct solution is easy to verify. This is proof-of-work system. Only with a correct solution can a block be committed and verified by all n/w members.
-  Once a node solves the PoW correctly and announces the transactions, other nodes on the n/w vote for its validity, and once the majority has voted to approve the block, nodes begin committing transactions to a new block to be amended to the previous one and solving the new PoW for it.
- The node that commits a valid block of transactions to the network, recieves a block reward consisting of brand new bitcoins added to the supply along with all the transaction fees paid by the people who are transacting.


<u> 
Whereas in modern central bank, the new money created goes to finance lending and govt spending, in Bitcoin the new money goes only to those who spend resources on updating a ledger
</u>

Nakamoto programmed Bitcoin to produce a new block every 10 minutes, and for each block to contain a reward of 
- 50 coins in the first 4 years
- 25 coins in the next 4 years
- ...
- halved every 4 years



### Bitcoin: difficulty adjustment

As more people choose to hold Bitcoin, its value increases and makes mining new coins more profitable..which drives more miners to expend more resources on solving Proof-of-work problems.. More miners  means more processing power, which would result in solutions to the PoW being arrived at faster, thus increasing the rate of issuance of new bitcoins,.

BUT, as the processing power rises, Bitcoin will raise the difficult of the math problems needed to unlock the mining rewards to ensure blocks will continue to take around 10 minutes to be produced.

<u>
Whereas tise in value of any money leads to more resources dedicated to its production , as Bitcoin's value rises, more miners does not lead to production of more bitcoins...it just leads to an increase in processing power needed to make the n/w more secure and tough to break
</u>

### Bitcoin: Security

The security of bitcoin lies in asymmetry between **cost of solving PoW to commit a transaction to the ledger** and **cost of verifying its validity**.

It costs ever increasing Kwh of electricity and processing power to record transactions....but cost of verifying the validity of transactions is close to 0.

### Bitcoin : Economics

Bitcoin can be thought of as an autonomous **firm** which provides a new form of money and a new payments n/w. There is no management or corporate structure to this firm, and al decisions are automated, pre-programmed. 

The value proposition of this firm is that money supply is completely inelastic in response to increased demand and price; instead increased demand just leads to safer n/w due to the mining difficulty adjustment. Miners invest electricity and processing power in the mining infra that protects the n/w because they are rewarded from it.

Bitcoin users pay transaction fees and buy the coins from the miners because they want to utilize digital cash and also benefit from appreciation over time., and in the process they finance the miners' investment in operating the n/w. The investment  in PoW mining h/w makes the n/w more secure.

The more the demand for the n/w grows, the more valuable the miners rewards and transaction fees become, which necessitates more processing power to generate new coins, increasing the company's capital, making the n/w more secure and the coins harder to produce.

It is an economic arrangement that has been productive and lucrative to everyone involved, which leads to the n/w growing at an astonishing pace.


## Ch-9 : What is Bitcoin Good For?

### Store of Value
In fact, everything is in abundance, we just need to devote enough man power to extract them. Nothing in particular is scarce. In the book "Ultimate Resource", the author claims the only term for which "resource" applies is human time.

Absolutely no need to worry about resources . Not only are they abundant, the exisitng reserves and stock piles have only increased with our growing consumption. Our tech advancement allows us to produce them at a lower cost in terms of time, and their prices have also decreased with time.

**Scarcity is only relative** in material resources, with the differences in cost of extraction being the determinant of the level of scarcity.

Earth being at the edge of catastrophe is just scaremongering.

As monetary inflation proceeds, the large number of bubbles can be understood as speculative bets for ways to find a useful store of value. Americans recently started using their homes as a medium of savings, the supply of housing was increased so much that the price came crashing down.

If bitcoin were to be adopted widely  to carry out transactions, the cost of on-chain bitcoin transactions is likely to rise steeply, making it less feasible for individuals to carry out uncensorable on-chain transactions to get around govt rules and regulations. In that situation, the wide adoption of bitcoin will have far larger +ve impact on people's freedom, by reducing govt's ability to finance its operation through inflation. In a society run on hard money, govt impositions that are not economically productve are unlikely to survive for long as there is little incentive to continue financing them.

### Internation and Online Settlement

- Traditionally gold was the medium of settlement
- But non scalable across locations, i cannot buy things sitting here, transfering gold is cumbersome
- Led to centralizing of gold, and issuing cheques, govt notes backed by gold
- but centralization on the hands of few, nevertheless

Whereas govt confiscated people's gold savings and forced them to trade with money supposedly backed by gold, people are able to keep the bulk of their bitcoin savings in storage away from the govt hands and only use smaller amounts to transact through intermediaries. The very nature of bitcoin tech puts govt in severe disadvantage compared to all other forms of money, making confiscation harder.

### Scaling: Bitcoin as a reserve currency

 Bitcoin is actually not scalable to large number of small transactions per day, as there is a hard limit. So bitcoin can be seen as a new emerging reserve currency for online transactions, where the online banks will issue bitcoin-backed tokens to users while keeping the hoard of bitcoins in cold storage. Each person will be able to audit in real time the holdings of the bank, and with online verification systems able to verify that no inflation is taking place....This would allow an infinite number of transactions to be carried out online without having to pay the high transaction fees for on-chain transactions. 

 Bitcoin itself cannot scale to have every single txn in the world to be broadcast to everyone and included in the block chain. There NEEDS to be a secondary level of payment systems which is ligher and more efficient. Bitcoin backed banks will solve these problems. Different banks can have different policies, some would have fractional reserve while others might be 100% Bitcoin backed. Interest rates may vary....Most Bitcoin txns will occur BETWEEN banks, to settle net transfers. 

<u>
	As Bitcoin continues to evolve in the direction of having a higher market value with higher transaction fees, it starts to look more and more like a reserve currency than a currency for everyday transactions.

The first central bank purchase of bitcoin ( to hold as reserve currency, and also as an insurance for their own extinction lol), will make value of bitcoin rise significantly and make many other banks rush towards it.

### Global Unit of Account : break em trade barriers

Global trade has been hampered by the differences in currency values across different countries. This destroyed people's ability to conduct indirect exchange using single medium of exchange.

- gold was an option
- but phsycially carrying gold is not an option
- centralize it
- centralization --> leads to --> temptation to abuse power and cause inflation by printing money
- gone



## Ch-10:  Bitcoin Questions.

Anyone who joins a Bitcoin n/w generates

- public addres
- private key

Analogous to email address and password..

When a transaction is made, the sender broadcasts it to all other nodes, who can verify the sender has enough bitcoins to fulfill it, and that he has not spent these coins on another transaction (double-spending). Once a txn is validated by a majority of CPU behind the n/w, it is inscribed onto the **common ledger** shared by all n/w members(nodes).

Proof-of-Work involves the nodes competing to solve math problems that are hard to solve but whose solution is easy to verify. All bitcoin txns verified in ten minute window are transcribed and grouped together into a **block**. 

Nodes compete to solve the PoW math problems for a block of transactions, and the first node to produce the correct solution broadcasts it to the network, who can very quickly verify its correctness. Once the validity of the transactions and PoW are verified by the majority of nodes, a set quantity of bitcoin is issued to reward the node that correctly solved the PoW. This is called "block subsidy", and the process of generating new coins is called "mining", this is the ONLY way the supply of coins can be increased. On top of block subsidy, the node that correctly solved the PoW also gets the txn fees from the senders.

Nodes who expend the processing power have a very stong incentive to NOT include any invalid txns in their blocks to receive the block reward. Since it is far cheaper to verify the validity of txns and the PoW than to solve the PoW, nodes attempting to enter invalid txns into a block are doomed to fail , ensuring that their expended processing power goes unrewarded.

By relying entirely on verification, bitcoin dooms fraudulent txns to failure and obviates any need for trust in anyone.

**For an attacker to try to insert fraudulent txns** into the bitcoin ledger, he would need to have a majority  of the processing power behind the n/w to accept his fraud (more than 50% of the network). as of 2017 there are 2 trillion laptops in the network . 2 million times larger than the processing power of the world's largest supercomputer.

- PoW makes cost of writing a block very very high
- and cost of verifying its validity very very low.

Two ways

- Through treasury bills
- By lowering the interest rates.

Second one is more popular: by reducing the interest rates, it encourages startups, businessmen to borrow more... and you should know that Banks create money out of thin air through the process of lending.

> Banks can only lend out the deposits they already have
- is a total joke.


There are 3 theories of banking

- The financial intermediation theory ( now rejected )
- The fractional reserve theory ( now rejected )
- Credit creation theory

Quantity Theory of Credit : C = (C)r + (C)f . Says that the allocation of bank credit determines what will happen with the economy : good or bad.
- Cf : Non GDP credit (fake economy credit)
- Cr : GDP credit (real economy credit)
- If the money lent is used just for consumption (without growth) ...it will lead to inflation without growth.
- If the money lent is used to buy assets (because well "housing market is booming, FOMO, i better buy and sell later )...then it causes asset inflation, bubbles, banking crises
- If the money lent is used to create new goods and services, money used productively and industriously...then you have Growth WITHOUT inflation, even without unemployment!!!

Banks can lend out even when they have NOTHING in their coffers, if not for the "reserve ratio" 

Say person A deposited 100/- in the bank; and say the reserve ratio is 10%. i.e the bank is free to lend 90% of the deposits to ay borrower. Say person B borrowed 90/- from the same bank. By giving the money to the borrower while keeping it available to the depositor, the bank has effectively created 90/- out of nowhere! Tomorrow if person A demands his money back, the bank is obligated to return 100/- back to him, ...at any point in time!

##### What is Quantitative Easing (QE) ?


##### What causes recession | financial crises ?

##### How does Debasement | OR | pumping/printing more money into the system cause Inflation ?
 See [Quantity Theory of Money](https://www.investopedia.com/insights/what-is-the-quantity-theory-of-money/) Which states that more the money supply,
  more the price levels of the goods. The same forces that influence the supply-demand of commodities, apply to supply-demand of money..An increase in supply of money, decreases the value of one unit of money, and hence it has less buying power, so prices increase..More money is now chasing the same amount of goods, so prices rise. But the case is different if supply of goods is at the same rate as the money being printed. Then prices can remain the same.

Consider this. You are a shady king, you love debasing when you run out of money. You dont want to appear bad by taxing the citizens, but you have no money left to spend too. So you debase and devalue the gold coins by mixing copper into them and create new coins "out of thin air". You dont tell anyone and send back the debased coins back to the citizens. Now you spend these coins for your lavish lifestyle, and by doing so you have pushed these coins into the general public economy. Now the economy as a whole has more coins than it had earlier. More money is chasing the same amount of goods, so goods price shoot up :)
