# VCs dont fund everything
unlike earlier, very small amount of VC funding goes to R&D and startups. Most of the VC money goes to already well funded (via govt and corporations) projects

VC money is not invested much on innovation, rather its invested on **commercialisation** of already innovated projects... into "growing the business", ... into marketing, sales, manufacturing.

# Where do VCs get the money from?
Very large institutions.. pension funds, insurance companies invest a small portion into VC funds. Since its a "small portion", and expected returns is 35-35% over the lifetime of the investment... VCs have a lot of freedom .
