# Chapter 1: Patterns

_A Pattern addresses a recurring design problem that arises in specific design situations, and presents a solution to it_

Pattern = < Context | problem | solution >

- Patterns help you build on the collective experience of skilled software engineers.
- _patterns are problem-solution pairs_
- patterns help you manage complexity
- pattern provides a solution schema rather than a fully specified blueprint

## Pattern categories

- **Architectural Patterns < Large scale >**
  - Aids structural organization of system
- **Design Patterns < Medium scale >**
  - aids refining subsystems/components of the system
  - aids refining relationships between subsystems
- **Idioms**
  - Low level pattern specific to a programming language

Architectural patterns can be used at the beginning of coarse-grained design, design patterns during the whole design phase and idioms during the implementation phase

## Pattern Systems

pattern system describes patterns uniformly, classifies them and shows how they are interwoven with each other. Pattern systems also help you find the right pattern to solve a problem or find alternative solutions to it.
