## Talk: Rust: A Language for the Next 40 Years

### Why C?
- proven for 40+ years
- performance, close to ASM
- uses very little resources
- portability - there's a C compiler for any platform
- Syntax is simple
- Stability, 

### Why not C?
- not memory safe
	- use after free
	- double free
	- memory leaks
	- buffer overrides/overwrites
	- null pointers
	- data races
- 70% of all vulnerabilities in Microsoft is due to memory safety issues.
- " Write code first, THEN make it safe " is the C way of doing things

### Rust is the new C
- Fixes memory issues
	- Ownership & borrowing.
