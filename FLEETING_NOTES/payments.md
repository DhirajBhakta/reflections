#### Card Payments
- developed world

#### Closed Loop Stored value Wallets

#### RTP (Real-Time Payment) systems
- bank a/c to bank a/c transactions at very low cost

## RTP Systems
- 50+ countries
- Govt <-> Regulators <-> Companies
- RTP systems are maintained by a central authority
- `Third Party`: an ecosystem player that develops financial technology to be used as part of an RTP. 
<u>They are provided access to the RTP system via APIs.</u> 
Third Party applications, through mobile payment apps or through
a trusted browser, can initiate payments.
In India, the decision to include Third Parties in the development of the model was key to this
growth and has helped spur innovation and adoption on a massive scale. Google has had the
opportunity to participate with the launch of Google Pay (formerly known as Tez).

- India -> UPI <2016>
- UPI was designed to include Third Party technology players.

### Concepts
- `Deemed Transaction` : a transaction whose status is not known.<br>We can assume them to be "deemed to be complete" or "deemed to be a failure", and then proceed. These can be marked later for manual resolution.

- `Settlement` : the process of moving money. That movement is complete when the funds are settled among the
institutions where customer accounts are held.

- `Mandate` :permission given by the user to the merchant to pull funds from a userâ€™s account. For example, a
user may let a subscription service set up a mandate to bill her account monthly for a fixed amount

- `PSP`: Payment Service Provider

- `Pull`: act of requesting funds.

- `Push`: act of sending funds.
