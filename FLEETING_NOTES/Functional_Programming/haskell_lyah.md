## Haskell
- _purely functional_ language
- purely functional = declarative
- You dont tell the steps in procedures, you just tell the **what** of things, **not how**
- Only Pure functions
- no side effects
- program = series of transformations on data
- Lazy evaluations everywhere...
- infinitely long/big data structures.
