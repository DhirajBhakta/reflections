# Define "Quality"

Quality is defined loosely by different stake holders in the team: testers, business, product, developers, users

Get in a room and come to a conclusion to agree upon expected qualities.

- Does it work at all? What are they key features, key technical qualities?
- Does it work well? What are the key performance, security, scalability aspects?
- Is it usable? What are the key usability scenarios?
- Is it useful? What production metrics will show that it is used in real work?
- Is it successful? What business metrics will show that this was worth doing? Is it operating within financial constraints?
