## End-to-End Tests / Acceptance Tests / Functional tests
Test the features as a user using a black box. Dont test internals but test that the system works as a whole &mdash; basically replace manual testing with automated feature testing.

## Integration Tests

## Unit Tests
Test a "unit" in isolation. Interactions(with the dependencies) to the 'outside world' are mocked or stubbed. 




## Regression Tests
Tests written when a bug was fixed, so that the bug never occurs again.

## Smoke Tests
