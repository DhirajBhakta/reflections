# habits to shake off
1. **"Planning and Organization is for nerds and losers" attitude.**
Having seen what chaos really means, I will never go back to this attitude again. 

2.  **I will do this big/important task once I finish all the shitty tasks.**
NEVER again! Things that matter the most should never be at the mercy of the things that matter the least.

3. **Use me like a slave. I will work my ass off for any task thrown at me. Because, there's something or the other to learn from every task. "koi kaam chota nhi hota" attitude**
Has single handedly destroyed my work-life balance. If youre so willing to sacrifice your free time, do it on very very high yield tasks. tasks that engage you a lot. Because you learn hell lot in less time with "bada kaam". fuck "chota kaams". Learn to say no to commitments. For every task that has to go in, some other task has to go out! and when it goes out, so will your investment in that half done task. Digest this.

The  ability  to  concentrate  singlemindedly on  yourmost important task, to do it well and to finish it completely, isthe   key   to   great   success,   achievement,   respect,   status,   andhappiness  in  life.  This  key  insight  is  the  heart  and  soul  of  thisbook

“Only  engage,  and  the  mind  grows  heated.  Begin  it,and the work will be completed.”

An  average  person  who  develops  the  habit  of  setting  clearpriorities and getting important tasks completed quickly will runcircles  around  a  genius  who  talks  a  lot  and  makes  wonderfulplans but who gets very little done.

The secret ofgetting ahead isgetting started.The secret ofgetting started isbreaking yourcomplexoverwhelm ingtasks into smallmanageable tasks,and then startingon the first one.—Mark Twain
Just start the work and dont stop until done!
Successful,  effective  people  are  those  wholaunch   directly   into   their   major   tasks   and   then   disciplinethemselves  to  work  steadily  and  single-mindedly  until  thosetasks are complete.
See/Visualize  yourself  as  thekind of person who gets important jobs done quickly and well on a consistent basis. Nanami Kento
Your  mental  picture  of  yourself  has  a  powerful  effect  on  yourbehavior. Visualize yourself as the person you intend to be in thefuture.  Your  self-image,  the  way  you  see  yourself  on  the  inside,largely   determines   your   performance   on   the   outside.   Allimprovements in your outer life begin with improvements on theinside, in your mental pictures.



## 1. Set the table
Here is a great rule for success: Think on paper.


Know your purpose

the  number  one  reason  whysome  people  get  more  work  done  faster  is  because  they  areabsolutely  clear  about  their  goals  and  objectives,  and  they  don’tdeviate  from  them. 

1. Decide exactly what you want

One of the very worst uses of time is to do something very wellthat need not be done at all.  
“Before  you  begin  scrambling  up  theladder  of  success,  make  sure  that  it  is  leaning  against  the  rightbuilding.”

2. Write it down

Unwritten goals are useless

3. Set deadline+subdeadlines

4. List down everything that you need/have to do for that goal

Break it down.

5. Organize the list into a plan
Priority and Sequence

6. Take action in your plan immediately
An  average  plan  vigorously  executed  is  far  betterthan a brilliant plan on which nothing is done.

7.  Resolve to do something every single day that movesyou  toward  your  major  goal. 
dont miss a single day

Keep Moving Forward

## 2. Plan everyday in advance
"taking  action  withoutthinking things through is a prime source of problems."

Always work from a list. Before you do something, add it to the list and then do it
"Always think on paper"

Make your list every night. You will actually "Sleep on it"

10/90 rule: use the 10% of the time to plan

## 3. 80/20 rule
Spend too much time on high-yield tasks
_Resist the temptation to clear up small things first._

## 4. Consider Consequences
The mark of the superior thinker is his or her ability to accuratelypredict  the  consequences  of  doing  or  not  doing  something. 

Thinking continually about the potential consequences of yourchoices,  decisions,  and  behaviors  is  one  of  the  very  best  ways  todetermine your true priorities in your work and personal life.

**Law of forced efficiency**: There is never enough time to do everything, but theres always enough time to do the most important thing.

You will never be able to do everything. Get that wishful  idea  out  of  your  mind.  All  you  can  hope  for  is  to  be  ontop  of  your  most  important  responsibilities.  The  others  will  justhave to wait

1. What are my highest value activities? (ask others too)
2. What can I and only I do, that if done well, can make real difference ?
3. What is the most valuable use of my time right now?

## 5. Practise creative procrastination
Procrastinate on low yield tasks

“If  I were not doing this already,knowing  what  I  now  know,  would  I  start  doing  it  againtoday?”

Find reasons to abandon low yield tasks in favor of new high yield tasks

## 6. ABCDE prioritization method

## 7. Focus on Key result areas (get better, get competent)

Your job can be broken down to 5 key result areas.

Grade yourself (1-10 scale) on each key area


The reverse of this is that the better you become in a particularskill  area,  the  more  motivated  you  will  be  to  perform  thatfunction,   the   less   you   will   procrastinate,   and   the   moredetermined you will be to get the job finished

“What  one  skill,  if  I  developed  and  did  it  in  anexcellent  fashion,  would  have  the  greatest  positive  impacton my career?”

## 8. Apply the law of 3

Before the day begins, "Whats the most high yield 3 tasks for the day?"

  What  are  your  three  most  important business  or  career goalsright now?2.  What  are  your  three  most  important family  or  relationshipgoals right now?3. What are your three most important financial goals right now?4. What are your three most important health goals right now?5.  What are your three most important personal  and  professionaldevelopment goals right now?6.  What  are  your  three  most  important social  and  communitygoals right now?7.  What  are  your  three  biggest problems  or  concerns  in  life  rightnow?

  It is the quality of time at work that counts and the quantityof time at home that matters.

  Work ALL the time you work.

## 9. Prepare thoroughly before you begin
Get it 80 percent right and then correct itlater.

## 10. Take it one oil barrel at a time
by the yard it’s hard; but inch by inch,anything’s a cinch!

## 11. Upgrade your Key skills
Continuous Learning
Everything  is  learnable.  And  what  others  havelearned, you can learn as well.

1. read a book everyday
2. take course, workshops, 

## 12. Leverage your special talent
One of your great responsibilities in life is for you to decide foryourself what you really love to do and then to throw your wholeheart into doing that special thing very, very well.
You cannot do everything, but you can do those fewthings  in  which  you  excel,  the  few  things  that  can  really  make  adifference.

## 13. Identify your key constraints
Whats holding you back?

In any task, **identify the limiting factor** and go all out to eliminate that

80/20: 80 percent of the constraints are internal, resolvable
Whether  you’re  trying  to  get  to  work  on  time  inthe morning or build a successful career, there are always limitingfactors and bottlenecks that set the speed of your progress.  Yourjob is to find them and to focus your energies on alleviating themas quickly as possible.
Starting  off  your  day  with  the  removal  of  a  key  bottleneck  orconstraint  fills  you  full  of  energy  and  personal  power.  It  propelsyou into following through and completing the job.  And there isalways something

## 14. Put pressure on yourself (create imaginary deadlines)
Do NOT wait for some external motivation.
You  increase  your  self-esteemwhenever  you  go  beyond  the  point  where  the  average  personwould normally quit.

## 15. Maximise your personal powers (Recharge)
Sometimes  the  very  best  use  of  your  time  is  to  go  home  earlyand   go   to   bed   and   sleep   for   ten   hours   straight. This   cancompletely  recharge  you  and  enable  you  to  get  two  or  threetimes  as  much  work  done  the  following  day,  and  of  a  far  higherquality, than if you had continued working long into the night. 

Take  regular  vacations  each  year,  both  long  weekends  andone- and two-week breaks to rest and rejuvenate. You are alwaysthe most productive after a restful weekend or a vacation.

High energy levels is underrated.

## 16. Motivate yourself into action
aim to be a complete optimist.

refuse  to  let  the  unavoidable  difficulties  andsetbacks of daily life affect your mood or emotions.

Optimists:
1. look for good in every situaltion
2. problems come to not obstruct but to instruct (learn from it)
3. Try to continuously think about solutions, next actions..instead of complaining
4. think and talk about your goals all the time


## 17. Get rid of technological time sinks

Constant need to use apps, to communicate, slack and all...leave you breathless
Bill  Gross, manager of more than $600 billion in fixed-incomefunds   and   bonds,   is   famous   for   exercising   regularly   andmeditating  daily  to  keep  centered  while  using  no  technology  atall.  He  turns  off  his  phones,  leaves  his  BlackBerry  in  his  office,and  exercises  without  the  continual  interruptions  of  people  whohave  an  overwhelming  need  to  stay  connected.  And  he  says  thathe never misses an important message

## 18. Slice and Dice the task

## 19. Create Large chunks of time
Schedule blocks of time for particular task

## 20. Develop a sense of urgency


Do not wait; the time will never be “just right.” Start whereyou stand, and work with whatever tools you may have atyour  command,  and  better  tools  will  be  found  as  you  goalong.

Get into the **flow** more often

"fast tempo " ----> key to ----->The Flow

One of the ways you can trigger this state of flow is by developinga sense of urgency. This is an inner drive and desire to get on withthe  job  quickly  and  get  it  done  fast.  It  is  an  impatience  thatmotivates you to get going and to keep going. A sense of urgencyfeels very much like racing against yourself.A  fast  tempo  seems  to  go  hand  in  hand  with  all  great  success.Developing  this  tempo  requires  that  you  start  moving  and  keepmoving at a steady rate. The faster you move, the more impelledyou feel to do even more even faster. You enter “the zone.”

## 21. Single handle every task
Momentum is key. the cost of getting back is way too high. So keep going and dont stop
self-discipline  as  “the  ability  to  makeyourself do what you should do, when you should do it, whetheryou feel like it or not.”

Starting a high-priority task and persisting with that task untilit is 100 percent complete is the true test of your character, yourwillpower, and your resolve.
