# Assertions
1. I am willing

## Self talk

Positive self talk can dramatically improve mood, productivity, confidence.
Positive self talk is key component to happy successful life

Negative self talk puts us in bad mood and leaves us feeling helpless. 
It can make small problems look bigger, and create problems where none existed before.
Sometimes negative self-talk leads to anger, sadness, or frustration thatmanifests in different or seemingly unrelated situations.

**your self talk is fukcing you over and in ways you can't even begin to imagine**

This kind of self-talk doesn’t make your life any easier. The more you tellyourself how hard something is, the harder it will actually seem.Unfortunately, since we are constantly listening to a steady stream of ourautomatic inner thoughts and have become so accustomed to the critical voicein our heads, we often don’t realize how negative thoughts impact our moodand behavior in any given moment and, as a result, we end up doing—or notdoing—things our rational minds want us to do.

>“If human emotions largely result from thinking,then one may appreciably control one’s feelings bycontrolling one’s thoughts – or by changing theinternalized sentences, or self-talk, with which onelargely created the feeling in the first place.”

### Neuroplasticity
As we go through life learning and experiencing new things, our brain isconstantly arranging and rearranging the neural pathways that control howwe think and behave. The best part is, we direct our thoughts in a way thatconsciously modifies these path ways for ourselves. And the easiest way toshape those thoughts is through conscious, decisive self-talk. The kind of talkthat “cuts through” and takes control of your life.

### Assertive self talk over Narrative self talk
I am relentless




## language
our language &mdash; It can seep into oursubconscious and become internalized, changing our thoughts and behaviorin the long-term.

## Stoicism
Outside events hold no power over us at all. We create our own reality with our minds.
> "Reject your sense of injury, and the injury itself disappears"


What if that thing you’re working toward, that thing you are sure will make you happier, better or more confident doesn’t happen? What then? Even if it does arrive someday, what happens to your life between now and that day?


## Blame Game
Cannot affort to waste time dwelling in blame game in your life.
Just look for solutions.

You must first accept that while thereare things have happened in your life that you had no say in, you are 100%responsible for what you do with your life in the aftermath of those events.Always, every time, no excuses.

## Willingness
Willingness is a stage in which we can engange with life and see a situation from a new perspective. 

"_I am willing..but_" . Every time you add the “but” to the end of that statement, you turn yourself into the victim.

Take the case, imagine for a moment, that willingness is missingin your life. Not some wispy, sheepish willingness but rather a boldwillingness, the kind of willing state where you are ready for what’s next andready to act on it. Willingness to change, willingness to let go, willingness toaccept.  Real, magical, inspired willingness

You need to first ask **Am I willing**?
Are you willing to live with a body that’s unhealthy? No. Are you willing to continue living paycheck to paycheck? No. Are you willing to put up withunworkable, unsustainable relationships? No.

## Assessing your goals
Do you really need it? Are you good without it? What are you putting on the line to achieve it?

All too often, we focus solely on what we don’t have, even though deepdown we don’t really need it or perhaps even want it. Even if you digest this, the next time you see a BMW, you will wonder "Why dont I have it?"

If you really want it, take actions consistently to achieve it. This is not a one-and-done deal.
But if you’re not willing to work an extra 10 or 20 hours a week just to driveto work in a BMW instead of a Honda, give up the complete waste of precious headspace to yearn for it. Stop pretending to yourself. Deal withyour unwillingness to take on the kind of actions accomplishing those thingswould require and accept that you have been bullshitting yourself. You’llhave a lot more capacity for loving the life you actually do have and createsome room to begin striving for the things <u>you actually want in life.</u>
