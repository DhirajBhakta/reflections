## Gita and its connection to vedas
bottomline is that Vedas take way too long to understand and finish to get its essence. Modernisation in the current world has left very little room for us to dedicate our life to understand vedas. So much that it is impossible for ordinary men to do it in one Life

Gita is the essense of Vedas. Hence its called "gitopanishad".

The message of the Veda and the Gita is the same: _the world is ultimately a source of pain, and the highest bliss resides in God alone_. The difference is in the delivery of the message. The Veda is hard to understand because its syntax, semantics, vocabulary, and tonalism require years of study to understand and make it subject to many interpretations; moreover, it’s ultimate message is sometimes concealed in elaborate discussions of ritual. It’s naturally inaccessible to most people.

## Origin of Gita (ch4)
Gita was first spoken to the sun-god, and the sun-god explained it to Manu, and Manu explained it to Ikṣvāku, and in that way, by disciplic succession, one speaker after another, this yoga system has been coming down. But in the course of time it has become lost. Consequently the Lord has to speak it again, this time to Arjuna on the Battlefield of Kurukṣetra.

## Spirit of Gita
On the attitude to have while reading gita...

It is natural to question every wording of the lord in our own interpretations and approach it in a bashful way according to the moral compasses of our own lives..

It is just like this: If we want to take a particular medicine, then we have to follow the directions written on the label. We cannot take the medicine according to our own whim or the direction of a friend. It must be taken according to the directions on the label or the directions given by a physician. Similarly, Bhagavad-gītā should be taken or accepted as it is directed by the speaker Himself. The speaker of Bhagavad-gītā is Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa. 

Every living being thinks that he is the lord and creator of the material world. Material consciousness has two psychic divisions. One is that I am the creator, and the other is that I am the enjoyer. But actually the Supreme Lord is both the creator and the enjoyer, and the living entity, being part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, is neither the creator nor the enjoyer, but a cooperator.

Vedic knowledge is not a question of research. Our research work is imperfect because we are researching things with imperfect senses. We have to accept perfect knowledge which comes down, as is stated in Bhagavad-gītā, by the paramparā (disciplic succession). We have to receive knowledge from the proper source in disciplic succession beginning with the supreme spiritual master, the Lord Himself, and handed down to a succession of spiritual masters. Arjuna, the student who took lessons from Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, accepts everything that He says without contradicting Him. One is not allowed to accept one portion of Bhagavad-gītā and not another. No. We must accept Bhagavad-gītā without interpretation, without deletion and without our own whimsical participation in the matter. The Gītā should be taken as the most perfect presentation of Vedic knowledge. Vedic knowledge is received from transcendental sources, and the first words were spoken by the Lord Himself. The words spoken by the Lord are called apauruṣeya, meaning that they are different from words spoken by a person of the mundane world who is infected with four defects. A mundaner (1) is sure to commit mistakes, (2) is invariably illusioned, (3) has the tendency to cheat others and (4) is limited by imperfect senses. With these four imperfections, one cannot deliver perfect information of all-pervading knowledge.

Submissive attitude is a must. Try not to be arrogant till the end.

We should not reject that which does not tally with our imagination; our attitude should be that of Arjuna: “I believe everything that You have said.”

## Meaning of life
_...is in being the eternal servant of Krishna_

You will be stuck perpetually within the cycle of birth and death until you accept this.

This generation preaches a false goal of material comforts to stay happy.

 By the spell of illusion one tries to be happy by serving his personal sense gratification in different forms which will never make him happy. This is the central point of Gita.
