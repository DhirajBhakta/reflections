- **3 questions per day**
  - have a fixed plan of action
  - have a deadline
- **pen+paper** before coding in the editor

  - O(n) : think about complexity
  - think about alternative solutions

- **Language of choice** : C++ clear winner

  - STL being the major reason
  - https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-compile-your-c-code-in-visual-studio-code/
  - setup good debugging environment...
  - get extremely good with your IDE.

- **Don't spend more than 30 mins** on any question.

  - give up only after 30 mins.
  - continuously think about starting point and final point in mind
  - look at hints
  - look at the answers in discuss section
  - google it off
  - if you have used hints, mark it for review after 2 weeks
  - summarize every question with one-liner, two liners
  - Every DSA topic has "patterns". Label every question with these patterns.
  - Master C++ STL on the go.

  - **PostMortem:**

    - Go through the solution
    - Go through the editorial
    - Make notes, divide into steps
    - add the list of bugs you encountered to a master list.
    - Label the question and put it into the right bucket
    - commit to git (plus for staying motivated)

  - **There are no new problems**
    - all questions are more or less derived from the same pool of questions
