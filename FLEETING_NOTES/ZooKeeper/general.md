ZooKeeper is a pillar for distributed systems.
- Distributed configuration management
- consensus/election
- coordination & locks
- key-value store


Zookeeper looks like a filesystem, a Tree..
- each node is called a  "zNode" 
- and each node has a path
- each zNode stores data.
- each zNodes can be "watched" for changes (subscribe for updates)
