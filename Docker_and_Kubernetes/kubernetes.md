# Introduction

K8s exists to simplify the task of building, deploying and maintaining distributed systems.
Its important to understand the **core challenges of distributed systems** that led to the development of k8s.

You care only about your application. You just want it deployed... in one logical unit that abstracts everything underneath....**The Cluster**

You just want to _define_ the application in a YAML file (manifest), and let Kubernetes handle the rest.

**"The rest"?**

- Say a `node` in the cluster just died, and killed off some containers with it
  - Kubernetes will see this and starts replacement containers on the host
- Say a container became "unhealthy"
  - Kubernetes will restart it.
- Say a `component` is under high load/stress.
  - Kubernetes will start extra copies of the component in new containers.

**Your Job** :-> Define the Dockerfile and the kubernetes YAML file properly. You specify WHAT you want to happen

**K8s' Job** -> Make sure `CURRENT STATE == DESIRED STATE` ( a self healing app ). It figures out HOW to make it happen.

# Terminologies [brief]
- Container Orchestrator
- Kubernetes "objects"
- Kubernetes "controller"
- Pods
- Labels and Annotations
- Services
- Ingress
- ReplicaSets
- Deployments
- DaemonSets
- Jobs
- ConfigMaps

## Container Orchestrator

- You have many nodes
- You want to run your "service(s)" on all those nodes, with replicas of each service
- container orchestration is the automation of much of the operational effort required to run containerized workloads and services.
  - provisioning
  - deployment
  - scaling (up and down)
  - networking
  - loadbalancing

### What problems does Kubernetes solve?

- rise of microservices -> rise of container tech
- increased use of containers
- managing 1000s of such containers using scripts and self made tools made it complex and irritating
- scaling , deployment and recovery
- what if one of the container goes down?
- HA(no downtime).
- checking if one container has crashed across multiple nodes is hard
- K8s automatically checks the health of every container
- ensures that theyre always running
- K8s can spin up multiple containers (horizontally scale) and have a load balancer in front of it
- easy rollback
- Not restricted to any cloud provider
  - AKS (Azure)
  - EKS (AWS)
  - GKE (GCP)
- Automatically configures your infra
- speeds up deployment
- allows you to build complex apps
- Kubernetes brings infra level concerns like the following into app configuration
  - Load balancing
  - networking
  - storage
  - compute

### What do we mean by "reliable, scalable distributed systems"?

- more and more services are delivered over the network via APIs
- these APIs are often delivered by a distributed system, the various pieces that implement the API running on different machines, connected via the network and coordinating their actions via n/w communication.
- These systems must be _highly reliable_, they cannot fail, even if a part of the system crashes or stops working
- They must  _available_ even during rollouts and other maintainence events
- They must be _scalable_, so that they can grow their capacity to keep up with increasing usage without radical redesign of the distributed system.

### ECS, Mesos, Cloudfoundry, Marathon, ...wtf??

These are cloud-specific  orchestrator offerings

But Kubernetes and Docker Swarm is infrastructure agnostic
Cloud will deploy/manage Kubernetes for you. Also, Infrastructure vendors are making their own distributions of Kubernetes.

Independence and standardization are the main reasons Kubernetes is so popular. Once you have your apps running nicely in Kubernetes you can deploy them anywhere, which is very attractive for organizations moving to the cloud, because it keeps them free to move between data centers and other clouds without a rewrite. It's also very attractive for practitioners - once you've mastered Kubernetes you can move between projects and organizations and be very productive very quickly.

#### Which Distribution of Kubernetes should I choose?

- You can choose a cloud distribution (AWS EKS, GKE)
- Self managed (Docker Enterprise, Rancher, Openshift, Canonical, VMWare PKS)
- ! Dont use the pure upstream Github Kubernetes!

#### whats all this minikube, microk8s, k3s

- This is for local development.
- Single node cluster

> The primary goal of minikube is to make it simple to run Kubernetes locally, for day-to-day development workflows and learning purposes.

- k3s
  - `curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh -s - --docker --disable=traefik --write-kubeconfig-mode=644`

#### Kubernetes vs Swarm

- Swarm :- EASY
- Kubernetes :- FEATURES & FLEXIBILITY

#### Immutable Infrastructure

#### Declarative Configuration

- IaaC - Infrastructure as a Code : the idea of storing declarative configuration in source control.
- as opposed to imperative configuration, where the state of the world is defined by the execution of a series of instructions.

### Self Healing Systems

_continuously_ take actions to ensure that the current state matches the desired state.

- Operator Pattern:
  - more advanced logic needed to maintain, scale, and heal a specific piece of s/w(like MySQL, or Prometheus) is encoded into an **operator application** that runs as a container inside the cluster.
  - The code in the operator is responsible for more targeted and advanced health detection and healing that can be achieved via Kubernetes' generic self-healing.

# Kubernetes

### Basic Architecture

![](../assets/kube-06.png)

Node: A machine. ( host/machine/Ec2/VM etc ) with defined CPU and RAM<br>

- one Master Node
  - runs kubernetes processes to run and manage the workers properly
  - It has the following running
    - **the API server** (which is also a container)
      - Communicates with kubelet on worker nodes
      - kubectl talks to the API server.
    - **the Scheduler** (where to put the pod?)
      - checks for "tasks"-to create and assign pods from the Controller manager
    - **the Controller manager** (detect crashes of pods, and recover)
      - runs reconciliation loop.
      - keeps looking at current state - desired states configs and creates tasks(task to create pods) for the **scheduler** to assign to nodes.
    - **the etcd** (key value store of cluster state)
      - stores the current state config and desired state config
- multiple worker Nodes
  - worker node is where actual applications are running
  - each worker node has the following
    - **Kubelet**
      - Kubelet talks to the containers through the CRI interface (Container Runtime Inteface)
      - communicates with the master node
      - makes sure that the containers are running within pods
    - **Kube Proxy**
      - allows for n/w communication inside and outside the node.
      - responsible for routing n/w traffic to load balanced services in the cluster. Kubeproxy runs using DaemonSet.
      - Note that many of the kubernetes control plane components are run using kubernetes itself!
    - **Container runtime**
      - Kubernetes doesnt care what container runtime you use. containerd? docker? no issues.
  - each node has one or more containers running on it

![](https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781617297984/files/OEBPS/Images/1-1.jpg)

- API
  - define your applications
- Cluster
  - runs your applications
  - A cluster is a set of individual servers that have all been configured with a container runtime like Docker, and then joined into a single logical unit with Kubernetes

A cluster is a set of individual servers/nodes/hosts which have all been configured with a container runtime like Docker, and then joined together into a single logical unit with Kubernetes. The cluster, as one logical unit, runs your application. In normal usage you forget about the underlying nodes and you treat the cluster as a single entity. You can add Nodes to expand the capacity of your cluster.
A Kubernetes cluster consists of a set of worker machines, called nodes, that run containerized applications. Every cluster has at least one worker node
The worker node(s) host the Pods that are the components of the application workload. The control plane manages the worker nodes and the Pods in the cluster. In production environments, the control plane usually runs across multiple computers and a cluster usually runs multiple nodes, providing fault-tolerance and high availability.

### Basic flow

- You define your app in YAML files(manifest files)
- You send that YAML file to the Kubernetes API(via kubectl)
- Kubernetes compares the YAML and what’s already running in the cluster.
  - and tries to get to a desired state
  
## Kubernetes API?

Everything contained in Kubernetes is represented by a RESTful resource. Each Kubernetes object exists at a unique HTTP path, eg: `https://your-k8s.com/api/v1/namespaces/default/pods/mypod` leads to the representation of a Pod in the default namespace named `mypod`.

`kubectl` uses this API under the hood.<br>
To <u>Query and manipulate</u> the state of **objects** in Kubernetes <br>
Objects? := Pod || Deployment || Namespaces etc

Objects in the kubernetes API are represented as JSON or YAML files.These files are einter returned by the server in response to a QUERY or posted to the server as a part of an API  REQUEST.

`kubectl get <resourcename>`

`kubectl get <resourcename> <objectname>`

output as JSON or yaml? `-o json` or `-o yaml`

output a particular field? `-o jsonpath --template{.status.podIP}`

```
kubectl get pods my-pod -o jsonpath --template={.status.podIP}
```

# Kubernetes Resources (Objects)

- Pods
- ReplicaSets
- Deployments
- Services
- Ingress
- Secrets
- ConfigMap

Some objects are primitive objects (Pod, Service)

Some objects are controller objects (Deployment, ReplicaSet, DaemonSet). A controller is a Kubernetes Resource which manages other resources.

- `Pod` Run Containers.
- `Deployment` Runs Pods.
- `Kubernetes` Runs Deployments
![](https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781617297984/files/OEBPS/Images/1-4.jpg)

## Principal Principles

### [Controller Model](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/)

A Controller is a Kubernetes Resource which manages other Kubernetes Resources. It works with the Kubernetes API to watch the current state of the system, compares that to the desired state of its resources, and makes any changes it needs

Observe the _"Controller controls resources"_ pattern at play

![](../assets/kube-05.png)

### <u>Label system for identification</u>

- Labels are key/value pairs that can be attached to Kubernetes objects such as Pods and ReplicaSets.
- Labels help grouping Kubernetes Objects.
- examples
  - acme.com/app-version
  - appVersion
  - app.version
- `kubectl get deployments --show-labels`
- add a label to existing deployment `kubectl label deployments alpaca-test "canary=true"`
- remove label of existing deployment `kubectl  label deployments alpaca-test "canary-"`
- ![](../assets/kube-11.png)
- `kubectl get deployments --selector='!canary'`
- `kubectl get deployments --selector='canary=true'`

Any Kubernetes resource can have labels applied that are simple key-value pairs.
You can add labels to record your own data.
Kubernetes also uses labels to loosely couple resources, mapping the relationship between objects like a Deployment and its Pods. The Deployment adds labels to the pods it manages.
 Deployments add labels when they create Pods, and you can use those
labels as filters.

Using labels to identify the relationship between resources is such a core pattern in
Kubernetes . Resources can have labels applied at creation and then added, removed, or edited during their lifetime. Controllers use a label selector to identify the resources they manage. That can be a simple query matching resources with a particular label,

This process is flexible because it means controllers don’t need to maintain a list of all
the resources they manage; the label selector is part of the controller specification,
and controllers can find matching resources at any time by querying the Kubernetes
API. It’s also something you need to be careful with, because you can edit the labels
for a resource and end up breaking the relationship between it and its controller.

![](../assets/kube-03.png)
The Deployment doesn’t have a direct relationship with the Pod
it created; it only knows there needs to be one Pod with labels that match its
label selector. If you edit the labels on the Pod, the Deployment no longer
recognizes it.

### Kubernetes does NOT run conatiners

![](../assets/kube-10.png)

1. Kubernetes does not run containers -, it delegates it to node runtimes like docker, containerd, etc
2. It is the Node's responsibility (specifically, responsibility of the container runtime inside the node) to manage the pod and its containers.

    It does that by working with the container runtime using a known API called the Container Runtime Interface (CRI). The CRI lets the node manage containers in the same way for all the different container runtimes - it uses a standard API to create and delete containers, and to query their state. While the pod is running, the node works with the container runtime to ensure the pod has all the containers it needs.

![](https://drek4537l1klr.cloudfront.net/stoneman2/v-7/Figures/01_img_0002.jpg)

### Kubernetes Manifests (YAML files)

Kubectl `run` and `create` are imperative

Manifests are declarative.

YAML files are called application manifests, because they're a **list of all the components that go into shipping the app**. And those components are "Kubernetes resources"

- `Pod` :
- `Deployment`: A Controller for managing Pods
- ReplicaSet
  - They manage Pods
- Service

### ⛳️ `Pod`

![](https://drek4537l1klr.cloudfront.net/stoneman2/v-7/Figures/02-08_img_0001.jpg)

- Every container belongs to a pod.
- A Pod can container one or more containers.
- You should run ONE container in a pod. [Sometimes more]()
- A Pod runs on a single node in the cluster. (all containers in a pod always run on the same machine!)
- **A Pod is the  smallest unit of compute in Kubernetes.**
- A Pod has its own Virtual IP address.
- Pods can communicate with each other , even on different nodes, via the virtual network.
- Containers inside the same pod share the same network interface (NIC) as that of the pod, and can communicate via `localhost`
- You use a Pod for each component. You may have a website Pod, and an API Pod.
- Scaling applications = running more Pods

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: client-pod
  labels:
    app: client
spec:
  containers:
  - name: client
    image: laithharb/web-app:v1
```

- kind: is the kind of resource you wanna create
- apiVersion: is sort of a folder which has certain resources
  - v1: Pod, service, secret
  - apps/v1: Deployment
- metadata:
  - name
  - label: we give labels for a reason. see much below.
- spec
  - define multiple containers here

  -

### ⛳️ `Service`

- Pods need to communicate.
- IP addresses of Pods are used to route traffic
- but IP addresses of Pods change when Pods themselves are replaced (crash etc)
- So Kubernetes provides a network address discovery mechanism with **Services**
  - route traffic BETWEEN Pods
  - into Pods from the world OUTSIDE the cluster
  - from Pods to external systems

If you create a Pod, then you wont have access to it
The way to create access is via services: NodePorts, LoadBalancers

Browser -> KubeProxy -> Service -> Pod

Kubernetes gives a virtual network
Every Pod gets its own private IP address, but Pods are ephemeral, Pods die easily, new Pod will have new IP address.<br>
`Service` gives a permanent IP, `Service` can be attached to the Pod.
A service is also a `loadbalancer`

![](../assets/kube-07.png)
Types of Services

- NodePort (development)
  - external communication (access from browser for ex)
- ClusterIP
  - internal communication between pods
  - DB to server for example
- LoadBalancer (production)
  - external communication (access from browser for ex)
- Ingress

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: client-srv
spec:
  type: NodePort
  selector:
    app: client
  ports:
    - port: 3000
      targetPort: 3000
      nodePort: 30007
```

- selector: to interact with one of the pods

Service figures out which pod to route the traffic to
![](../assets/kube-12.png)

### Service Discovery

**Service-discovery tools help solve the problem of finding which processes are listening at which address for which services**

- DNS is the traditional system of service discovery on the internet
- DNS falls short for Kubernetes :(

 Once your application can dynamically find services and react to the dynamic placement of those applications, you are free to stop worrying about where things are running and when they move.

Service discovery in Kubernetes starts with **Service** Object

- A Service Object is a way to create a named label selector
- we can use `kubectl expose` to create a service

Kubernetes Service DNS

- great example of Kubernetes building on Kubernetes
- this DNS service is managed by Kubernetes
- this DNS service provides DNS names for cluster IPs

**ClusterIP**

- for routing requests WITHIN the cluster.
- default type of Service in K8s
- creates an IP that any node can access
- works only inside the cluster, so useful for communication between Pods
- Useful where some components are internal and should'nt be accessible outside of the cluster.

**LoadBalancer**
![](../assets/kube-14.png)

Will configure the cloud to create a new load balancer and direct it at nodes in your cluster.

- Routing External Traffic to Pods
- how long will you sit and do `kubectl port-forward`??
- Deploying a LoadBalancer service creates an actual load balancer in your cloud.
- the cloud LB sends incoming traffic to one of the nodes and the K8s routes it to a Pod

**NodePort**
![](../assets/kube-15.png)

NodePort: allow traffin INTO the cluster.<br/>

- you dont use nodePort in production
- useful for development only

**ExternalName**
![](../assets/kube-16.png)

- this kind of service helps communicate outside the cluster
- say your DB is RDS and hence is outside your cluster where your app is running
- K8s implements ExternalName Services using a std feature of DNS - CNAMEs.

-

Basic concept behind service discovery in Kubernetes: _Deploy a Service resource and use the name of the Service as the domain name for components to communicate._

### How Kubernetes routes traffic

- Pods have their own IPs and communicate with each other using those IPs
- The virtual n/w in K8s spans the whole cluster. So Pods can communicate via IP address even if theyre running on different nodes.
- But IPs change as Pods are killed/replaced
- Enter **Services** (DNS)
  - Services allow Pods to communicate using a fixed domain name.
  - Services have their own IP address
  - Concept: deploy a Service resource and use the name of the Service as the domain name for components to communicate

The service is an abstraction over (Pod+its n/w address), just like a Deployment
is an abstraction over (Pod+its container)

<div style="color:white; background-color:black; padding:1em; border-radius:4px; box-shadow: 0 0 5px black; font-style:italic; margin:4px">
A Kubernetes Cluster has a DNS server built in &mdash; which maps Service names to IP addresses
</div>

### How Service Discovery Works(Service Resolution)

![](../assets/kube-17.png)

- ClusterIP is a virtual IP address that doesn't exist on the network.
- Pods access the n/w through the **kube-proxy** running on the node, and that uses packet filtering to send the virtualIP to the real endpoint.
- Services can exist intependently of any other parts of the app
- Services keep their IP addresses as long as they exist
- Services have a controller that keeps the endpoint list updated whenever there are changes to Pods, so clients always use the static Virtual IPs and the Kube-Proxy always has the up-to-date endpoint list

![](https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781617297984/files/OEBPS/Images/3-3.jpg)

This set up can get pretty messy when you have a lot of pods that need nodePort/LoadBalancer. This is where **ingress** service type comes in.

![](../assets/kube-13.png)

### ⛳️ `Ingress`

Gives doman name to service IPs

External Service and Internal service

##### Why bother with pods? Why doesnt Kubernetes handle the containers directly (bypassing the pods)?

Kubernetes doesn't really run containers - it passes the responsibility for that onto the container runtime installed on the node, which could be Docker or containerd or something more exotic. **That's why the pod is an abstraction**, it’s the resource which Kubernetes manages whereas the container is managed by something outside of Kubernetes.

#### What should I put in a Pod?

You shouldnt place a Wordpress container and a MySQL container in a singe Pod. Why? because you wouldnt want to scale them together as a unit lol!!

The right question to be asked is "Will these containers work correctly if they land on different machines?". If the answer is "No", then place both containers in the same Pod.

#### Pod Manifests

The yaml declarative configs - definition of the Pod

The Kubernetes API server accepts and processes Pod manifests before storing them in persistent Storage(etcd). The Scheduler also uses the Kubernetes API to find Pods that haven't been scheduled to a node. The scheduler then places the Pods onto nodes depending on the resources and other constraints mentioned in the Pod manifest.

### ⛳️ `Deployment`

Its a "Controller" for managing `Pods`.A deployment’s primary purpose is to declare how many replicas of a pod should be running at a time. When a deployment is added to the cluster, it will automatically spin up the requested number of pods, and then monitor them. If a pod dies, the deployment will automatically re-create it.Using a deployment, you don’t have to deal with pods manually. You can just declare the desired state of the system, and it will be managed for you automatically.

> The pod is a primitive resource and in normal use you’d never run a pod directly, you'd always Create a controller object to manage the pod for you.

##### But whyy?? why not just use the Pods directly?

 Pods are isolated instances of an application, and each pod is allocated to one node. <u>If that node goes offline</u> then the pod is lost and Kubernetes does not replace it. You could try to get high availability by running several pods, but there's no guarantee Kubernetes won't run them all on the same node. Even if you do get pods spread across several nodes, you need to manage them yourself

 Enter `Deployment`, the Controller object for `Pods`

 ![](https://drek4537l1klr.cloudfront.net/stoneman2/v-7/Figures/02-08_img_0006.jpg)

If a node goes offline and you lose the pod, the deployment will create a replacement pod on another node; if you want to scale your deployment you can specify how many pods you want and the deployment controller will run them across many nodes.

**How does it keep track**?? &mdash; Via labels<br/>
<div style="color:white; background-color:black; padding:1em; border-radius:4px; box-shadow: 0 0 5px black; font-style:italic; margin:4px">
Controllers use Labels to identify the resources they manage. <br/>
Using labels to identify relationship between resources is a core pattern in kubernetes.
</div>

<div style="color:white; background-color:firebrick; padding:1em; border-radius:4px; box-shadow: 0 0 5px black; font-style:italic; margin:4px">
Watch out!: you might break the relationship between a resource and its controller by editing the labels
</div>

![](https://drek4537l1klr.cloudfront.net/stoneman2/v-7/Figures/01_img_0004.jpg)

### ⛳️ `ReplicaSet`

![](../assets/kube-18.png)

- Deployments dont actually manage the Pods directly. Its done by ReplicaSets.
- Deployment is a controller that manages ReplicaSets and ReplicaSet is a controller that manages the Pods.
- Deployments can manage multiple ReplicaSets
- When you sclae a Deployment, it updates the existing ReplicaSet to set the new number of replicas, but if you change the Pod spec in the Deployment, it replaces the ReplicaSet and scales the previous one down to zero.

-

Mostly same as Deployments (but actually its Deployment minus rollouts rollbacks).

### ⛳️ `StatefulSet`

Mostly same as Deployments (have concept of "replicas")

But each replica has a sticky identity., identity which doesnt go away when a pod is restarted.

### ⛳️ `DaemonSet`

A pod that runs on EVERY node in the cluster.

Say you want to grab all logs from every node and send it to ElasticSearch. &mdash; you use DaemonSets.

### ⛳️ `Job`

Does some work and ,,,exits.

:

### ⛳️ `Ingress Controller`

Fulfills the routing rules defined by `Ingress`

### ⛳️ `ConfigMap and Secrets`

external configuration of your application.
attach ConfigMap to Pod
attach Secret to Pod

### ⛳️ `StatefulSet`

Just like Deployment

### ⛳️ `Volumes`

attaches a physical storage to Pod.
Can be from the node, or from a remote node.
![](../assets/kube-09.png)

`hostPath` type is suitable when you want to use the volume from the host, i.e the node. If the Pod is restarted on another node, you will lose this data. For this , use `nfs` or `iSCSI`

## ConfigMaps and Secrets

< Configuration Management in the Cluster >, Config Injection

Simplest way to provider configuration is through **environment variables**

```yaml
spec:
  containers:
    - name: mongo
      image: mongo
      env:
      - name: SOME_VAR
        value: "100"
```

Example where env variables are sourced from a configMap and a Secret

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: adminer-web
spec:
  ports:
    - port: 8082
      targetPort: 8080
  selector:
    app: adminer-web
  type: LoadBalancer
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: adminer-web
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: adminer-web
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: adminer-web
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: web
          image: adminer:4.7-standalone
          args: ["php", "-S", "0.0.0.0:8080", "-t", "/var/www/html"]
          env:
          - name: ADMINER_DESIGN
            valueFrom:
              configMapKeyRef:
                name: adminer-config
                key: ADMINER_DESIGN
          - name: ADMINER_DEFAULT_SERVER
            valueFrom:
              secretKeyRef:
                name: adminer-secret
                key: ADMINER_DEFAULT_SERVER

---

apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: adminer-secret
type: Opaque
stringData:
  ADMINER_DEFAULT_SERVER: "ch04-lab-db"

---

apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: adminer-config
data:
  ADMINER_DESIGN: "price"
```

Example where configMap is loaded as a volume mount

```yaml
spec:
  containers:
    - name: web
      image: kiamol/ch04-todo-list 
      volumeMounts:                  # Mounts a volume into the container
        - name: config               # Names the volume
          mountPath: "/app/config"   # Directory path to mount the volume
          readOnly: true             # Flags the volume as read-only
 
  volumes:                          # Volumes are defined at the Pod level.
    - name: config                  # Name matches the volume mount.
      configMap:                    # Volume source is a ConfigMap.
        name: todo-web-config-dev   # ConfigMap name
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap                  # ConfigMap is the resource type.
metadata:
  name: todo-web-config-dev      # Names the ConfigMap.
data:
  config.json: |-                # The data key is the filename.
    {                            # The file contents can be any format.
      "ConfigController": {
        "Enabled" : true
      }
    }
```

## Storage

- volumes
- mounts
- claims

**The Problem:** if an app in one Pod was storing data on that node, then say the Pod went down, the replacement Pod (which might get deployed on another node) won't have access to that data.

You need cluster-wide storage, so Pods can access the same data from any node.

**Where can a container write data**

- its own writeable layer ( a container is nothing but layers of read only layers and one writable layer on top)
  - this data gets lost on container restart.
- **EmptyDir** type volume
  - is pod level volume, mounted as a volume into the container.
  - has the same life cycle as the Pod
  - useful for temporary storage
  - useful as a local cache (API responses for eg:)
  - if the Pod is restarted, the data survives
  - if the Pod is replaced, the data is lost!
- **HostPath** volume
  - is node level volume
  - if the Pod is replaced, it will have access to the files, but only if it runs on the same node.
  - if the node goes offline, you will lose the data.
  - also, Danger! Mounting a HostPath can give you complete access to the filesystem on the node (if / is mounted)
  - limit what the container can see by declaring subpaths in this case.
- **Persistent Volumes and Claims**
  - distributed storage systems
  - AzureDisk, ElasticBlockStore, NFS, GlusterFS

## Object Ownership in Kubernetes

Controllers use a label selector to find objects that they manage, and the objects themselves keep a record of their owner in a metadata field.

When you delete a controller, its managed objects soon will get deleted. Kubernetes runs a garbage collector process that looks for objects whose owner has been deleted, and it deletes them too.

If you fiddle with the labels, you can break relationships.

## Health Checks

Liveness health checks run application-specific logic(eg:loading a web page) to verify that the application is not just still running, but is functioning properly.
![](../assets/kube-08.png)

- Liveness Probe
  - Since "liveness" is application specific, you have to specify them in your pod manifest.
- Readiness Probe
  - Readiness describes when a container is ready to serve user requests. Containers that fail readiness checks are removed from service load balancers.

## Kubernetes YAML file &mdash; Defining Deployments in Application Manifests

Advantages over manually running commands

1. YAML files are declarative
2. You can write comments, to explain your decisions.

### Structure &mdash; 3 parts

1. metadata
2. specification
3. status ( added by kubernetes automatically )

A `template` section has its own metadata and specification

#### Examples

1. [YAML for defining a pod](cfg/kube-01.yaml)
2. [YAML for definign a deployment](cfg/kube-02.yaml)

A Simple web app

- needs three Kubernetes resources
  - 2 Deployments
  - 1 service

### Routing external traffic to Pods

Type of service called "LoadBalancer"

### Routing traffic outside Kubernetes

Type of service called "ExternalName"

## Supplying Configurations &mdash; ConfigMaps & Secrets

**Approach 1: env variables**

- can provide the classic env variables via the YAML file
- BUT, you cant change env variables of the Pods on the fly
  - env vars are static for the lifetime of the pod
  - you can only do so with a replacement Pod

**Approach 2: ConfigMaps**

Some good rules

- default app settings are baked into the container image
- Environment specific settings can be stored in ConfigMap
- any others that you need to tweak a little can be applied as env variables in Pod specification for the Deployment

## Storing data

- volumes
- mounts
- claims

_What happens if a container died and killed all the data it contained along with it_??

=>>
"EmptyDir" volumes share the lifecycle of the Pod. These volumes are the Pod lvl, so death of container != death of the contents of EmptyDir... it lives on.

_What happens if a Pod died and killed all the data it contained along with it_??

==>
"HostPath" volumes share the lifecycle of the Node. Data is physically stored on the node, and data is maintained between Pod replacements

_What happens if a Node died and killed all the data it contained along with it_??

==>
Persistent Volume

## Scaling applications = more Pods

- a "Pod" is the unit of Compute in Kubernetes
- Deployments manage Pods ( they actually manage replicasets which inturn manage Pods)

![](https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781617297984/files/OEBPS/Images/6-1.jpg)

 the Deployment is a controller that manages ReplicaSets, and the ReplicaSet is a controller that manages Pods.

core of scaling: you run as many Pods as you need, and they all sit behind one Service. When consumers access the Service, Kubernetes distributes the load between Pods.

## Namespaces

Why?

- to Structure your components, organize objects in the cluster
- avoid conflicts b/w teams
- share services b/w different environments
- Access and Resource limits on Namespace level
  
```
example namespaces
- default
- kube-system
- kube-public
- kube-node-lease
```

## Contexts

`~/.kube/config`
Contexts are used to manage different clusters

`kubectl config use-context my-context` or use `kubectx` instead

## CRD (Custom Resource Definition)

Kubernetes Operators

# Helm

Package Manager for Kubernetes

### Helm Chart

bundle of YAML files.
`Helm install chartname` makes it simple to install complex stuff

# Playing with Kubernetes locally (Single Node Cluster) via K3s

##### Step 0 : Install k3s

`curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh -s - --docker --disable=traefik --write-kubeconfig-mode=644`

Note that this also installs `kubectl` for you!

##### Step 0.1: Check that your cluster is up and running

`kubectl get nodes`

![](../assets/kube-02.png)

##### Step 1.1 : run a pod with a single container

`kubectl run test-db --image=postgres`

 `kubectl port-forward test-db 5432:5432`

##### Step 1.2 : list all the pods in the cluster

`kubectl get pods`

##### Step 1.3 : show detailed information about the pod

`kubectl describe pod test-db`

`kubectl  get pod hlo -o json` --> much more detailed

##### Step 1.4 : Lets try deleting a container

![](https://drek4537l1klr.cloudfront.net/stoneman2/v-7/Figures/02-08_img_0004.jpg)

##### Step 2.1 : Lets create a deployment

`kubectl create deployment es --image=elasticsearch:2`

then list the pods `kubectl get pods`

You can observe that creating a deployment --> creates  pod(s). Its a _deployment-managed-pod_ :)

##### Step 3.1 Let's deploy using a YAML file

`kubectl apply -f pod.yaml`

### A Note about debugging . ( "How do I `docker exec....` ")`

[How do i get a shell into my application container?](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug-application-cluster/get-shell-running-container/)

- Your container runtime may not give you access to work
with containers directly
- a managed Kubernetes cluster won’t give you control of
Docker or containerd

`kubectl` to the rescue!

You can run commands inside containers with kubectl and connect a terminal session, so you can connect into a Pod’s container as though
you were connecting to a remote machine.

##### Check the internal IP address of the first Pod we ran

`kubectl get pod hello-kiamol -o customcolumns=NAME:metadata.name,POD_IP:status.podIP`

##### run an interactive shell command in the Pod

`kubectl exec -it hello-kiamol -- sh`

##### inside the Pod, check the IP address

`hostname -i`

##### and test the web app

`wget -O - http://localhost | head -n 4`

##### leave the shell

`exit`

# Misc Notes

## Bash autocompletion

```bash
echo "source <(kubectl completion bash)" >> ${HOME}/.bashrc
```

## Helm

### Verdaccio local docker image with k3s and helm

Basically the deployment.yaml takes images which it can pull only from docker.hub or some registered **registries**. local images is not possible with k3s

##### Why local images is not possible with k3s?

its the containerd runtime causing this limitation. If you use docker as the runtime, then you can use local images with `imagePullPolicy:Never`

##### Why not use docker as runtime with k3s then?

```
curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh -s - --docker
```

is the command to run k3s in docker... However, in arch linux, I got an error saying `kubelet uses cgroupfs but docker is using systemd` .Couldnt debug further, and resolved to find out how to import local images into containerd somehow

##### `import` local images into k3s containerd

```
docker save --output verdaccio.tar verdaccio/verdaccio:local 
sudo k3s ctr images import verdaccio.tar
```

Post this, `helm install npm --set image.tag=local .` inside `charts` directory works like a charm!

# Debugging

### logs

`kubectl logs <podname>`

### exec into a container

`kubectl exec -it <podname> sh`

### Copy files from the container into the local machine

`kubectl cp <podname>:/usr/share/nginx/html/index.html  /tmp/index.html`
