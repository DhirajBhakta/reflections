#### Learning something new | Working on a new project

_Knowing what to learn... when starting something new._  . . . Extension of 80-20 rule.

- Priming and Scanning: Know the "why" for the thing. Why and how it fits into the bigger scheme of things. Observe examples. Make up examples, and verify if they're right. The "why" will propel you forward why motivation runs dry.
- Very quickly identify what the foundational knowledge is(should be)
- Create a not-so-rigid curriculum to quickly become an expert.
- Be ruthless for first 20 hours to hammer the initial memory, the core of your developing mental model... then slow down and take things slow. This is where you apply spaced learning, interleaving and all that. But first 20 hours - absolutely ruthless.


#### Memory
Long Term Memory | Short Term Memory | Working Memory

Long-term memory (hard drive of brain)
- First cognitive process that is used while programming is long-term memory
- This can store your memories for a very long time
- Use it or lose it: After 2 days, just 25% of the knowledge remains in your LTM.
Short-term memory
- Short-term memory is used to briefly hold incoming information
- The estimates differ, but most scientists agree that just a few items fit in short-term memory, and certainly not more than a dozen
- Like the computer's RAM or a cache that can be used to temporarily store values
Working memory
- The actual “thinking,” however, happens in working memory
- Like the processor of the brain

Lack of knowledge -> Issue in long-term memory .
Lack of information -> Issue in short-term memory .
Lack of processing power -> Issue in working memory.

#### But I can always look up the internet ...
Sure, the internet has made it easier to NOT want to store in the head, (rise of second brain culture).. But, struggling with basic things, the act of looking up elsewhere(internet included), takes up cognitive overload...and you're essentially stealing brain cycles from being totally immersed in the bigger complex problem.

The mere act of looking up syntax is a context switch, and a context switch is goddamn costly!

So, is learning syntax of your language ..ingraining it into muscle memory a nerdy, useless and stupid thing to do? ABSOLUTELY NOT. When you're able to flesh out for loops, switch statements, if conditions...without fumbling, you're truly coding at the speed of thought, and ALL your thoughts are about the broader, bigger problem you're solving...not the damn for loop syntax!! 

For any skill:
_**Set some time aside every day to practice and continue until you can consistently perform the tasks without any effort.**_
Remember how efforts into touch typing, increasing WPM, and learning VIM has payed off exponentially now.



#### Motivation to be a lifelong learner
Short term memory is extremely small, can juggle just 6-7 things at once., and hence you _better_ have the most important things in there for the current task at hand.

Think databases: extremely large sets of data stored on disk, "indexes" being built and rebuilt constantly, and indexes are small enough to be loaded completely into RAM, ... some time-series DB's even go as far as to _chunk_ up data such that associated indexes can be stored in goddamn CPU cache!

The more things you learn, the more you "rebuild" your index, and its that index that will get loaded into your short term memory. More the data, better the index.

#### What fulfills an engineer?
- the desire to control one’s own work,
- the desire to get better at things
- the desire to work toward some goal beyond showing up for 40 hours per week and collecting a paycheck.

The moment the above go out of the window, the person becomes an hollow shell, and starts finding answers to meaningless questions like "whats the purpose of life", might spiral into burnout.

#### Interruptions
> An avg programmer has just ONE uninterrupted 2hr session per day

After an interruption, it takes 20 minutes to get back into the zone.
