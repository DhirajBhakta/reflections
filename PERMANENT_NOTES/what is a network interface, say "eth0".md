Network interface is usually physical... the NIC card, but can be virtual as well. It is a **point of connection** between a **computer(router/switch/PC/...) and the underlying network(network medium)** (private or public).

Network interface (virtual) can be implemented entirely in software. Ex: **loopback interface** 127.0.0.1 or ::1.

When we refer to IP address of a machine, it is indeed the IP address of the network interface. **IP addresses are always assigned to the network interfaces**.
