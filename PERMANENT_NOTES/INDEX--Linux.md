learn `iptables`
im confused a lot: 2 ways to do the same thing: add a route to routing table || OR || add rule to iptables  ?? wtf why?? and how??
what and why is dhcp required??
### Tools
[[ip is the new ifconfig]]


# Hardware
### CPU 
[[hyperthreading - CPUs vCPUs]]
Single Socket CPU vs Multi-socket CPUs (i3 cpu is for eg: single socket, with 4 cores on same socket)
What is NUMA? memory controller attached to every cpu socket. Enabled on only multi-socket CPUs.
### Memory 
[[accurate process memory consumption]]
What is SRAM and DRAM? SRAM is extremely fast, and is used for L1,L2,L3 cpu caches.
Why do we have both SRAM and DRAM in single PC? SRAM is for CPU caches.
