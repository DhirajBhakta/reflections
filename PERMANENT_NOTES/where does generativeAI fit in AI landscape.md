GenerativeAI is built using **supervised learning**.

### More datapoints != better accuracy
2010-2020 : people kept increasing the amount of data points for supervised learning and didn't see much improvement in accuracy. But increasing the size of the models ("large models"), which have say, way **too many neural nodes**, which need significant CPU,mem, they got far better accuracy improvments.
