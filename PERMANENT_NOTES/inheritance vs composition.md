In inheritance, you re-use the features of the Base class.. in Composition, you use use the features of the contained object (encapsulation)


You cannot modify inheritance chains at runtime, but you can change inner objects (composition) at runtime.

Multilevel Inheritance is a pain (Diamond Problem), but you can house N objects within another object and use their features (composition)

> **Note**: These apply to "Inheritance vs Aggregation" too. See [[aggregation vs composition]]
