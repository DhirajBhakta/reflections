# Examples

### RHEL
- `rpm` is the package manager for RHEL and Centos.
- `yum` is the preferred user-friendly package manager for RHEL and Centos. `yum` uses `rpm` under the hood, hiding its complexities.
- `dnf` is the successor of `yum`. 

### Debian
- `dpkg` is the package manager for Debian and its derivatives like Ubuntu.
- `apt` is the preferred user-friendly package manager for Debian and its derivatives. `apt` uses `dpkg` under the hood, hiding its complexities.

### Arch Linux
- `pacman` is the package manager for Arch Linux.
- `yay` or `yaourt` etc are package managers for installing packages from AUR. 
- TODO
	- what is AUR, what is PPA, from where does pacman or yay download the tar packages from? what is the URL? i did not find the url in [Arch Linux - Package Search](https://archlinux.org/packages/) or in [AUR (en) - Packages (archlinux.org)](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages) ? what is mirrorlist ? what is PKGBUILD?
