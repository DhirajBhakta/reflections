Q) When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

--Especially when im working (collaborating) with other members of my project team, i need to send my progress
  to the remote repo so that anyone can view and pull my project.
  It also serves as a backup...

Q) Why would you want to always pull changes manuaaly rather than having your Git local repo automatically stay uptodate with your remote repository?
  I like pulling changes manually because that way, when I'm working on code,
    it doesn't change without me expecting it.  For example, if I know the new version of some code is broken, I might not want to pull that change until I know that  the bug is fixed.
