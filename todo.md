## Lessons learnt 

#### Personal
- Almost always, a big problem is made up of multiple small problems. Aim to direct your energy in splitting these out and do divide and conquer. This applies to studying complicated topics as well. Just make sure not to silence the questions popping up in your head like "XYZ? what is XYZ? why did the author even talk about XYZ here? how is it related here? how does this fit into the bigger picture?". Note these down and explore the answers to these questions in depth
- Strictly use a Tracking tool to track every single book you read, every single tech you're studying. [Asana](https://asana.com/) works like a charm.
- Summarize your notes(in Markdown preferably) for every book/every concept you study and commit it to your repo
- DO NOT read a tech book in one shot in one weekend. Space it over a month atleast!
- Stop working for your company beyond 9-5 at any cost. **No compromise on this**
    - Helps you timebox your tasks, and stay very productive
    - Helps you remind yourself you have stuff to learn over and beyond the company work
- **If you are in flow, dont, DONT drift away to that topic** . Instead, add it to your "braindump" section in task tracker and forget about it! This will save you hours in a day

### Work Ethics
- Follow [Boy Scout Rule](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/97-things-every/9780596809515/ch08.html) only when there is a very good test suite in place. Otherwise, DONT edit other's code. You're just inviting unnecessary trouble. If Massive refactoring is needed, call it out, get the time allotted, write a test suite skeleton and keep youre fingers crossed as you rewrite the mess.
- Deliver according to your promised timelines no matter what! This is crucial to prove your reliability. So learn good estimation skills. 
- DONT underestimate. Its an invitation to severe burnout and depression/questioning your worth scenes etc.
### Portfolio 
- Start making a portfolio like [This guy](https://nvbn.github.io/about/). Document all the books youve read and tech youve experimented with. PS: this guy has an excellent collection of must read books. Preferably finish them all in a span of 2 years
- For portfolio, Make github gists in markdown for all topics, and link them in your portfolio by providing a brief introduction
- Also research a bit about effective portfolio making for developers.
