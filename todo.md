# System Design

- [Primer 2](https://github.com/checkcheckzz/system-design-interview)
- [Primer 3](https://github.com/shashank88/system_design)
- [Netflix 1](https://medium.com/refraction-tech-everything/how-netflix-works-the-hugely-simplified-complex-stuff-that-happens-every-time-you-hit-play-3a40c9be254b)

## Lessons learnt 
- Strictly use a Tracking tool to track every single book you read, every single tech you're studying. [Asana](https://asana.com/) works like a charm.
- Summarize your notes(in Markdown preferably) for every book/every concept you study and commit it to your repo
- DO NOT read a tech book in one shot in one weekend. Space it over a month atleast!
- Stop working for your company beyond 9-5 at any cost. **No compromise on this**
    - Helps you timebox your tasks, and stay very productive
    - Helps you remind yourself you have stuff to learn over and beyond the company work
- **If you are in flow, dont, DONT drift away to that topic** . Instead, add it to your "braindump" section in task tracker and forget about it! This will save you hours in a day

### Work Ethics
- Follow [Boy Scout Rule](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/97-things-every/9780596809515/ch08.html) only when there is a very good test suite in place. Otherwise, DONT edit other's code. You're just inviting unnecessary trouble. If Massive refactoring is needed, call it out, get the time allotted, write a test suite skeleton and keep youre fingers crossed as you rewrite the mess.
- Deliver according to your promised timelines no matter what! This is crucial to prove your reliability. So learn good estimation skills. 
- DONT underestimate. Its an invitation to severe burnout and depression/questioning your worth scenes etc.
### Portfolio 
- Start making a portfolio like [This guy](https://nvbn.github.io/about/). Document all the books youve read and tech youve experimented with. PS: this guy has an excellent collection of must read books. Preferably finish them all in a span of 2 years
- For portfolio, Make github gists in markdown for all topics, and link them in your portfolio by providing a brief introduction
- Also research a bit about effective portfolio making for developers.
